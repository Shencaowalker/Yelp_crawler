    	GREAT! Coffee place love all the different options that this place provides. I don&#39;t know about you but when an employee makes a STELLAR recommendation based upon my likes and dislikes I look forward to my next visit. The employees are friendly and courteous! Just an all around treat from beginning to end. This little gem has a nice vibe and very quirky decorating which adds to its character.  Can&#39;t wait till the weather warms up to enjoy my iced Thai coffee and blueberry scone

	It&#39;s a hit or miss here.  I avoid it when it&#39;s super busy because there is literally no room inside to wait in line or wait for your drink if there are more than a couple people waiting.<br>Multiple times when I&#39;ve ordered cold brew there has been an extremely foul after taste, it almost tastes like vodka.  Same with americanos, so I assume it&#39;s something about their beans.  Some of the employees are reallyyy rude and condescending.  One of the cashiers gave me serious attitude because I accidentally said grande instead of medium???? I guess I&#39;d be mad too if I were a grown man serving people in food service, haha.  <br><br>ALSO the font on the Crossroads sign painted on the outside of the building is the worst thing I have EVER SEEN.  IT&#39;S SO FOUL!!!!! I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE NO ONE HAS REALIZED HOW DISGUSTING IT IS AND HAD IT REDESIGNED, HOLY COW IT&#39;S SO BAD.  IT&#39;S.  SO.  BAD.

    	Very cute place to just sit down, relax, and have a sip of coffee. My friend and I came here for ice cream and they had a handful of delicious flavors! I went for the mint chip and it was delicioussssss. Their interior is very unique...retro game machine as a table?? Very cool. I&#39;m definitely going back to try their coffee!

    	Came here on a rainy Sunday for brunch and it was super packed which is always a good sign of a legit place. The layout is chill and &#34;hip&#34; with either an old-school Pacman or Galaga game, nice touch. <br><br>We had to sit outside which would have been okay IF the tent actually kept you dry. Unless you sat in the middle you were going to get wet. <br><br>I ordered the breakfast burrito and the girlfriend ordered the egg and cheese bagel. The burrito looked great but was okay I guess, the worst part of it was that it was wet and fell apart. She thought the bagel was worth it and I wish I had ordered it myself. <br><br>All in all... I would come back but not because I suggested it.

    	I take my coffee pretty seriously, so I was pleasantly surprised at how good my vanilla latte was. Perfectly foamed milk and just the right amount of sweetness. Also had the Ultimate Grilled Cheese, which was fricken delicious. Best of all, they have live music most nights and tonight&#39;s band (Thoughts on Standby) set such a good vibe in the coffee shop. If I lived in Richmond I&#39;d be a regular!

    	Fifteen-ish years ago when Crossroads opened, Southside was gross. However, Crossroads, I believe, is the impetus for Southside becoming cool. And they&#39;re still doing great things all these years later. So glad to see them still thriving on their little corner.<br><br>Great place to grab a beer, sandwich, coffee, or ice cream and chill w/ friends.

    	Amazing ice cream!<br><br>They seem to always have this coffee stout flavor, which actually has subtle undertones of the stout that make it really unique. Another one I see that they have often is the espresso oreo.. I love coffee and I love Oreos, so that&#39;s always a favorite of mine.<br><br>I also love basic flavors, like the strawberry! When I come in late and order a cone, they love to press the ice cream into the cone so you get a ginormous portion. I usually order one scoop and can barely finish it!<br><br>Sometimes they bring in live musicians and I love that. The whole feel of this place is hip, plus it&#39;s delicious, and I would definitely recommend for a place to chill-study, for dessert, or to catch up with friends.

    	Really weird ice cream. My husband got the chocolate ice cream and it was like the texture of melting taffy. And tasted like pure Hershey&#39;s chocolate syrup. Definitely won&#39;t come back for the ice cream. The feel of the place is great though. Definitely a good spot to hang out and linger. They have old school video game tables. The pastries we ordered were decent. Not amazing, not gross.

    	---------------------------------<br>Overall:<br>- Whenever I see Crossroads Coffee &amp; Ice Cream I&#39;ve always made a mental note to stop by. I didn&#39;t think it would take nearly 2 years to finally stop in... but I regret not coming sooner! The decor inside and outside is quite funky with a mix up of lawn furniture. Definitely not your average coffee shop but in the best possible way. They have a large variety of items, so it&#39;s perfect for any size and any diverse crowd. Overall, this cute coffee shop gets an A+ from me. I&#39;m not surprised it&#39;s always well populated. <br>---------------------------------<br>Attire: <br>- Super causal <br>---------------------------------<br>Cost Estimate: <br>- Drip Coffee: ~$2-3<br>-Specialty drinks: ~$4-5<br>-Pastries: ~$1-4 <br>-Chai Tea: ~$3 <br>---------------------------------<br>Occasions to visit: <br>- Meet up<br>- Need to do work<br>- Looking for good coffee/drinks<br>- A place to relax inside with a book or outside given nice weather <br>- First date <br>---------------------------------<br>Service: <br>- Prompt, very friendly and attentive. Can&#39;t get any better!  <br>---------------------------------<br>What to order: <br>- Chai Tea latte. Generous on the spice and doesn&#39;t hold back. I love it.

    	Third star only because I used to spend all my time at this coffee shop. Then, the prices increased and the size of the sides decreased. They used to give a side of hummus away in a well-portioned bowl, and every now and then I&#39;ll pay the same price for a much, much smaller container. THEN, there were several times when we&#39;d get home and there was no hummus, which wouldn&#39;t be such a big deal if it wasn&#39;t so expensive. I finally called them because I had payed several times recently with out receiving it and the woman did not apologize, offer a coupon, offer a dang cookie at the least. I used to adore this place, bring all my friends and family. Not anymore, it just feels different to me now.

    	2 stars because the coffee was delicious! However past that this restaurant does not have much to offer. I ordered a ham egg  and cheese on a bagel.  The eggs came pre cooked out of the freezer and were microwaved. The bagel was blistering hot and chewy from being heated in a panini press. Maybe its just because I&#39;m from New York but this breakfast place needs to step up their game. SIMPLY FRY YOUR OWN EGGS!

    	A hipsters paradise.  This place is great for a morning snack and drink.  I came in on Sunday and was met by a friendly staff dealing with a large crowd of customers.  They moved the line quickly and efficiently.<br><br>They have a wide variety of sandwiches both for breakfast and lunch as well as a variety of beverages, fruit juices, coffees and smoothies etc. I went with a basic sausage and egg sandwich, it was toasted nicely and the portion size was adequate.  Strawberry smoothie was delicious, real fruit juice and not overly thick to come off as a milkshake.<br><br>Definitely worth a visit for a quick bite but also hang around for the WiFi, the company and the overall atmosphere.

    	If you&#39;re looking for a place to feed all of your 90s needs look no further. Richmond&#39;s hottest coffee shop is Crossroads. They&#39;ve got good food, hot coffees of all varieties, a breakfast cabaret, and PAC man game for a table. This place gets super busy but that&#39;s always a good sign. The staff is friendly and the music is often times so 90s that I feel like I&#39;ve time traveled the second I walk through the door. Lots of dogs-always a plus.

    	I originally heard about Crossroads from my friend Stephanie who&#39;s a regular here. I can definitely see why she loves it so much. The atmosphere is cozy and kitschy. The mosaic and arcade tables and the fresh flowers add such a lovely touch - I haven&#39;t seen that in any other coffee shop. They get their pastries from a supplier and they are all delicious. I also love that they have so many syrup flavors because it makes everything very customizable. I wish I lived closer to this place!

    	If you are floating through your day with absolutely nothing to do, I can see this being an enjoyable place to go. If you&#39;re trying to get a quick bite, a coffee on your way somewhere, or you just don&#39;t like to feel held up for not much in return, pass.<br>Every time I come here I really want to like it, but I end up disappointed. The set up is weird and you have to struggle past the end of the line to get to the restrooms or even in and out of the door. The patio is cool but is covered in flies and doesn&#39;t keep the rain out. The employees are extremely sweet and smiley but I have a problem with a coffee house that seems like it&#39;s bojangling... The cashier last time I went, as sweet as I&#39;m sure she was, had ZERO sense of urgency with a line out the door. She walked very slowly everywhere, kept getting distracted, conversed with the barista for 2 minutes every time she went to hand off a cup, looked around and took a deep breath every now and then as if she was looking for something to do, I could go on... I definitely sound like I have a stick up my ass, and I was really trying to respect her for being so &#34;chill&#34;, but it seemed more like disrespect and a lack of work ethic to me. People were pushing others in line trying to make room for the rest of the line. I waited 40 minutes for 2 bagels (I really wanted their vegan cream cheese or I wouldn&#39;t have stood there that long...) - but the best part is, there&#39;s this little tiny sign on the counter when I was next in line, the sign that&#39;s supposed to tell the whole line of customers that they are in fact out of all plain and otherwise bagels and cream cheese. &#34;Does this mean you&#39;re out of plain bagels?&#34; I asked... To add insult to tardiness, it took the cashier a nice plump 15 seconds to let 2 words ooze out of her pretty smile... &#34;Sorry, yes...&#34; -___- Never coming back here unless I have my dog and it&#39;s my only option. The second star is simply because they have vegan cream cheese.

    	i have been a long time fan of this spot. However, went yesterday for the first time in a few years for a late lunch.<br>After 2 minutes of waiting for my turkey reuben, I was informed that I could have a regular reuben or one made with ham, and could still choose between chips or fruit. Instead, I opted for a breakfast burrito.<br>Assuming that eggs mean the scrambled kind, i soon found out that it did not! The eggs were more like egg salad eggs (whites only), but this would have been nice to know in advance. In addition, the onions overpowered the rest of the wrap, and the salsa was pretty plain to my disapointment. <br>I will try not to dwell on the fact that the breakfast wrap was $1.00 less than the Turkey Reuben, but staff did not offer to credit me the difference. The chips were the most bland of all, original Lays, and the fruit was not a fruit cup, but bananas, apples, or oranges that didn&#39;t look very appetizing.<br><br>As a final top-off, the grease from the wrap leaked through the foil and the bag, and exploded right on my slacks. So essentially for going out of my way to give this great local spot my business, I can tack on the cost to have my slacks dry cleaned.<br><br>note to self- get a coffee drink, ice cream next time, and/or try a better sandwich.

    	Pretty cool hipster spot. Visited early afternoon on a Saturday. Didn&#39;t seem too busy. There were several empty tables but seem crowded due to it being a small establishment with plenty of standing people carrying conversations. Most of which seemed interested in drinks only. <br><br>We were greeted by nice smiling employees. I ordered a breakfast burrito and a small milkshake. I got my milkshake fairly quickly. However, after drinking the entire thing and still not receiving our food, I began to get concerned with the turnaround. All in all, it took about 20 minutes to receive the breakfast burrito and a sausage croissant.<br>Once I received the breakfast burrito, it only had some of the items in it that were listed on the menu. It was missing onions and salsa. <br><br>Overall, it tasted good and certainly was filling...but I don&#39;t feel compelled to rush back.

    	I stopped in on a Sunday evening. Pretty busy; no seats inside but a few outside. The barista started brewed up fresh drip coffee right as I was ordering. It was worth the wait to enjoy the 100% Kona coffee. Live music inside was a nice surprise. The menus on the wall were all over the place (literally). I thought they served ice cream but couldn&#39;t find that menu, until I sat down outside and saw the ice cream menu on the far wall. Cute little coffeehouse...will definitely be back!

	Just moved back from Las Vegas and was looking for a new place. I have a complicated order or at least one that most baristas don&#39;t understand. They aced it. I made no additions or alterations to the drink, it was perfect both times with two different baristas. I love this place. I&#39;m so glad it&#39;s only four blocks from home. <br><br>The people are friendly and knowledgable. The quality of the coffee is unreal. I can&#39;t say enough. Five stars for sure.

    	Working downtown and need to grab a quick bite for lunch? Stop by Sefton, get your coffee fix and order the chicken pesto sandwich (or the turkey provolone if the latter is out), get your complimentary-with-sandwich-purchase baggie of trail mix (&#34;sweet monkey mix&#34; is my jammm) - be back in office 10 min later. 4 stars instead of 5 because sandwiches are slightly pricier than they should be for the portions, in my opinion, but not pricey enough to be considered excessive. <br><br>If this review was just for the coffee, it&#39;d definitely be 5 stars. I&#39;m a no-frills coffee drinker, so I frequently get just fresh brewed coffee here or an americano. However, they make a good cappuccino. Try asking for a couple pumps of their made-inhouse vanilla syrup (oomph, thank me later) if you&#39;re looking for something more sweet. <br><br>Speaking of sweet, I eventually caved and turned off my snobby &#34;thats not real coffee&#34; mentality and tried one of their espresso milkshakes as a treat yoself dessert. I kept seeing rave reviews for it from fellow Yelpers, and holy crap - SO worth it. SOOO worth it. Thanks for that tip, Yelp!<br><br>Parking: it&#39;s downtown so you probably expect this - street only. I never drove to Sefton so I honestly don&#39;t know where the closest parking is.<br><br>Service: always friendly, fast, and helpful! I&#39;ve never had a bad experience with the employees here.

    	I had a very similar experience here as I did at Rostov&#39;s coffee.  That is to say that I am not sure my coffee palate has been spoiled by strong/flavorful coffee, or is I have become some sort of coffee snob, or if the place was just having an off day.  <br><br>What ever the case I got a cup of iced coffee and it was distinctly lacking the typical breadth/width of tangy bitter flavor that I has come to be familiar to my pallet from drinking coffee at places like Lamp Lighter and Alchemy.  I was so taken aback by the lack of flavor in the that I literally turned around and ordered a second coffee drink on the spot to see if somehow the alternative menu item would have what I was looking for.  This other drink too was pleasant enough in its way by noticeably deficient in coffeeness.  <br><br>The store itself was cozy and pleasant but there was not enough substance to the non-coffee related experience to bring up the ratting a full star so in all I give the experience a 3.  So if you need a lovely downtown place to grab a cup of coffee and you are terribly particular about the &#34;coffee&#34; component of your chossen beverage then this place should not disappoint.

	Nifty little coffee shop with a nice vibe located in a decent location.<br>Pastries, Full range of flavored and classic espresso beverages and teas. The guy at the counter was friendly and efficient.<br><br>The latte I ordered was good I ordered an extra shot so it had a stronger flavor but I can tell the espresso roast they use is quality. Their machine is automatic but is timed well. I used to be a barista and I would like to say they are very knowledge able about coffee. I saw a google review saying this place didn&#39;t compare to Starbucks, and they are right its SO MUCH BETTER<br><br>I can honestly say I could frequent this place....about a year later and I do frequent this place :)

    	Couldn&#39;t decide on what to rate them. It&#39;s more like a strong 3.7 stars, so I rounded it up to a 4 :)<br>Hmm let&#39;s see. It&#39;s in downtown Richmond (around Virginia State Capitol, Secretary of the Commonwealth and so on) so the place was packed with people in suits trying to get their caffeine fix so I guess that&#39;s a good sign, right? <br>Even though it&#39;s somehow down the street from all the busyness, I appreciated their signage outside. Made it easier to find them. <br>The place is super cute with chalkboard signs about their coffee types as well as a great variety of drinks with delicious names. There were two people working and the cashier guy must have been having a bad day because I tried to have small talk and he just kind of shrugged me off. The girl preparing the drinks was friendly. They have ample seating for groups or solo coffee drinking :)<br>I ordered a ginger matcha green tea frappe and it took a while to prepare (2-3 people who ordered after me got their drinks before me). My drink tastes like its name - it had matcha green tea, ginger and crushed ice in it. It was refreshing on a warm day, but it wasn&#39;t worth the $5 something I was charged for it.

    	Hello Sefton! <br><br>After working in the area for a year and a half, how did I not know a local coffee shop existed so close? <br><br>I came here for a quick caffeine fix. This place has a positive cool vibe, a great way to break up the go go go aspect of work. <br><br>I ordered a pumpkin latte, my latest obsession. It was delicious. It tasted clean and even had specks of espresso powder giving the drink some texture. <br><br>This place also serves food. I haven&#39;t had it but will have to go back to try. <br><br>The service was great, friendly, quick and prompt.  I will be back to try other drinks of I can pry myself from the pumpkin latte!

    	I was immediately impressed by the extensive drink options listed on the wall, both hot and cold. Ultimately, however, I was underwhelmed by the two drinks I tried.<br>My partner and I ordered the Jamaican Iced Tea and the Espresso Soda.  The iced tea was fine, not authentic Jamaican at all, but that wasn&#39;t entirely unexpected. The Espresso soda was just bad. Almost undrinkable. <br><br>The location is great, and the inside of the shop is cute, so it&#39;s not a terrible spot to stop.  The worst thing about this coffee shop, and the reason for such a low score, is the high-pitched, wailing, murder-suicide soundtrack, noise pollution they blasted through the speakers.  I have never been to a coffee shop that played such terrible, tone-deaf music.  Maybe they know the singer personally and are trying to be supportive, or maybe they&#39;re just no catering to my demographic.  Whatever the reason, I couldn&#39;t bare to sit through that again.

    	This place is trendy, modern, and their coffee is on point.  One of the most well balanced and tasteful coffees I&#39;ve ever had!  I had the iced honey breve which proved amazing and I also tried my friend&#39;s vanilla cinnamon latte which was even better!  I enjoyed that they had symbols next to their coffees corresponding with a chart telling what each symbol means I regard to the flavor notes of the coffee. <br><br>Definitely should check this place out when in the area!

They have cute indoor seating (no outdoor seating unfortunately).  I recommend trying there iced cinnamon vanilla latte or the iced lemon cookie latte. They&#39;re conveniently located in walking distance of the State Capitol building and MCV&#39;s campus!

    	Not only is this my favorite coffee shop in Richmond, but its probably one of my favorite coffee shops ever. <br><br>From the cute little details (pet fish, lots of tasty snacks, coffee beans in bulbs hanging from trees) to their creative drink menu, I was sold. In fact, I came on Tuesday originally for a meeting and just had to drop by one more time before leaving on Wednesday. I even went out of the way for it.<br><br>Also, although I typically only take cream in my coffee (and pass on sweeteners,) from here on out I shall use honey to sweeten my coffee. Maybe not every time, but honey is my new new in my coffee. To think, all these years I spent drizzling sweet honey into my tea while neglecting to think about how wonderful it would be in coffee. It&#39;s my new jam!<br><br>Of course I also had to try the Jamaica Iced Tea (Hibiscus, cinnamon, lime, soda water.) I always tend to give a curious side eye before tasting a rendition of something that represents my fam&#39;s culture, but this was actually so good and creative! For anyone that&#39;s had sorrel, it&#39;s slightly reminiscent albeit a bit lighter and more refreshing. I loved it!<br><br>Definitely going to make sure I work in a Sefton visit every time I&#39;m in Richmond from here on out!

    	Sadly, I had a disappointing experience with this shop. The shop itself is super cute with chalkboard menu&#39;s, quaint, but uncluttered space, and even had festive decorations for Halloween. The coffee was adequate, service time was fast, but the customer service of the cashier and barista were sub par. It wasn&#39;t that early in the morning - maybe 8:20 on Wednesday - so they&#39;d been open for about an hour, the place wasn&#39;t busy, just one or two tables were occupied, but the cashier didn&#39;t even smile and seemed put out to have to take my order and await my signature on the ipad. The man who man who made the coffee gruffly put my drink on the counter. No one said thank you. (Virginia is still the south, ya know!) I may give them another chance, but not excited about visiting again.

    	This is my first time in Sefton. As a VCU student, I&#39;ve exhausted all of my coffee house options around the Monroe Campus because they&#39;re all very crowded. I took Ram Ride (student transportation) downtown in search of a new coffee shop to find this gem on 8th and Franklin! <br>I had to wait a little longer for my doppio con panna because the barista was made FRESH WHIPPED CREAM for me. I got time fo&#39; that. Chill spot, would highly recommend!

    	Bought a house brew with cream. It was the right strumpf. It tasted good enough that i will make them a go-to spot for $2 coffees near the VA State House and my orifice. This place is real small but cheery inside. The few seats are occupied by laptop peckers.

    	I loved this overall experience. The shop is a cute hole in the wall type place, very warm and inviting inside. The staff are friendly and accommodating, and I enjoy the bar area at the counter where you can sip a cup of tea or coffee. I got the seasonal roast of the day, and it was delicious. Not too bitter, flavorful, and extremely smooth. I asked for a 12 oz of whole bean to take home, as well. It was packaged up in an adorable bag with twine tying it together. They also appeared to have some great sandwich selections as well. I&#39;m definitely coming back next time I&#39;m in Richmond.

    	The employees know their stuff and take espresso drinks seriously, ethically sourced single origin beans from around the world, and an absolutely adorable interior for coffee dates or work days or whatever. What more could a coffee hipster want? The iced honey breve is my favorite right now; it&#39;s dangerously easy to slurp down, considering the double shot.

    	Woohoo! I&#39;d heard so so many good things about Sefton and when I found myself in the area the other day, I just had to go check it out. <br><br>This is a pretty small coffee shop, but it is so darn charming. I felt overly comfortable there like I could fall asleep or set up camp for a full day of work. You probably already know what I ordered if you follow my reviews. The infamous chai tea latte gets me every time! I had to see how Sefton does it. *Drumroll Please* It was... just ok. I gotta be honest, I was expecting more from my drink. Maybe it needed a little more chai and less milk? I can&#39;t put my finger on it. And the purpose of stopping by was for a little afternoon pick-me-up but it didn&#39;t really pick me up. <br><br>Can&#39;t win &#39;em all! But you know what, Sefton is still amazing. I mean, the atmosphere alone with the lights and the quirky chalkboards, seating, tables, everything! You can tell that the owner put a ton of care into the place, making it as inviting as possible. I just wish that the inviting atmosphere spilled out onto 8th street! Unfortunately there is construction going on that totally ruins the mood, but that&#39;s ok. Construction is only temporary. <br><br>I&#39;m definitely stopping by again in the very near future to try another drink. Or maybe other homemade goodies! I loved that you can buy homemade trail mix that was separated into different flavors. <br><br>Until next time, Sefton!

    	I cannot believe I waited so long to come here. I&#39;m ashamed of myself for not having these perfect, heavenly pastries the moment I moved to Richmond. This place is nothing short of bread heaven. I had the fig and cheese croissant and it was easily one of the best things I&#39;ve eaten in my life--flaky, buttery, not too sweet. MMMMMmmm. Thank goodness I don&#39;t live in Church Hill because damned if I wouldn&#39;t die a happy, yet impoverished and early death from eating nothing but pastries every day.<br><br>This is a absolute must-stop if you&#39;re in the neighborhood. Their coffee is great as well, staff was really nice when I came in on a busy Sunday morning too. I can&#39;t say enough great things about Sub Rosa. They do things right there.

    	To be honest, we were underwhelmed. We got a couple pastries (I got the fig and cheese), a tea, and a latte, and it was all very meh. My croissant was over-baked and dry - it basically just crumbled when I tried to bite it. The man who rang us up was not friendly; he didn&#39;t welcome us when we walked in or offer any suggestions on what we should order. In fact, I think I thanked him, because I can be awkward like that. :) <br><br>This was our first stop in Richmond, so I was worried that we weren&#39;t going to like any of the places I&#39;d planned for us to visit (I also jump to conclusions). Luckily, the employees at every other place were welcoming and happy to cook delicious things for us. It&#39;s just puzzling to me why so many people recommend this place.

Great latte, with great latte art...it&#39;s the little things. Tasted some of their bread, and it was too good to be true. They make it from scratch in house, so I will be back for a loaf for a special dinner. <br><br>Friendly staff, plenty of seating inside and out! Lovely place.

    	What a nice place to enjoy weekend breakfast/brunch! I tried the salami &amp; cheese pastry along with the quiche. While both were good, I liked the salami &amp; cheese a lot more and it definitely met expectations I had after reading all the reviews for it.  Also tried my friend&#39;s greens &amp; feta pastry which I also enjoyed. I like how they display the pastries out for you to see. Definitely will be back to try their other items!

    	I will always distinctly remember the time when I discovered Sub Rosa Bakery because it was around the time my boyfriend and I both gained 10 lbs because we were here every single Saturday morning. <br><br>This has to be the BEST bakery in Richmond. Not only are all their baked goods absolutely delicious, but many of the local restaurants serve their bread on their menu. If you&#39;re not part of the morning pack on the weekends you&#39;ll sometimes have to wait for the consecutive batches to come out and the line can get very long - but it&#39;s completely worth the wait. I&#39;ve tried every single item on the menu and my favorites are the salami and cheese and fig and cheese. I don&#39;t know how they do it but their pastries are so flakey and buttery! <br><br>The space is small and cute and really captures the feeling of a local bakery. I only wish that I could enjoy my food here more often because all of the eating spaces are always taken!

    	I truly love this place. I think because it seems like a jewel in the rough maybe. I like low key mom&amp;pop type vibes these days and this bakery feels authentic. I tend to get a double espresso, salami&amp; cheese croissant or the lamb borek which never fail but I&#39;m sure everything is fresh and delicious.<br>No complaints whatsoever.

    	Sub Rosa gets so much hype, but I can honestly say it&#39;s one of those few places that totally deserves all of it. They are masters at their craft and everything--from the bread to the pastries to the tea/coffee--is delicious. If I didn&#39;t live and work 15-20 minutes away I&#39;d be here all the time. I frequently daydream about their breads and pastries. You can&#39;t go wrong no matter the choice.

    	Sub Rosa&#39;s pastries are freaking delicious. After eating two, I ordered another for later. The cherry and pistachio croissant/tart/whatever-you-call-it rocked my world. My only complaint is that despite the tempting menu, the pastry case had a very limited selection. At least next time I will be in the know: come early!

    	Unclear why anyone has given a poor review. I picked up a loaf of the classic, a sour cherry and pistachio pastry, and a cheese and salami pastry for lunch with the family. Before leaving I had a cup of the Turkish tea, it was well blended and nothing short of perfect.<br>The loaf of bread we sliced thinly to make some gourmet sandwiches and it&#39;s flavor alone was enough for me. The rest was used at dinner to dip in oil and herbs which it was perfect for. <br>My only complaint about the pastries is that I didn&#39;t buy more of them. The sour cherry surprised the picky eaters in my family with its light and sweet flavors. The savory salami and cheese was wonderful, we heated it up a bit to make it melty and there was a bit of a scrum for who would get the last bite. <br>Unfortunate that this is the first time I&#39;ve ventured here but I will not be staying away for long!

    	Amazingly tasty daily bread, croissants and many other yummy carbs that you won&#39;t be able to resist... <br><br>Pogaca; a type of baked stuffed good with feta cheese is a must try. It goes well with Turkish tea. <br><br>I highly recommend the open face croissant salami-cheese. The Mille-feuille is so crispy and buttery that it melts in your mouth. <br><br>Not the best place for gluten-free diet. Two big tables for groups of six, and some small seats for couples etc. <br><br>No parking, so you might need to try  street parking in the nearby streets. <br><br>From Wednesday to Friday, they serve Turkish pide (flat bread).  Great for pick up. Quick service although no table service.

    	Like many on here, I&#39;m astonished by the one star review.  Sub Rosa&#39;s owners have given Richmond a unique, high quality pastry experience that is putting us on the map with their recent James Beard nomination.  Naysayers be damned - I&#39;ll continue disobeying doctor&#39;s orders while supporting a very worthy small business.  If anyone finds the prices to be a barrier, you&#39;re welcome to split the calories with me.

    	We came here for coffee and a baked good, to support the business and enjoy the view as patrons sitting inside looking at passerby&#39;s. We were impressed with the high quality baked good, appreciated the excellent service but found the prices excessive. <br><br>Our baked good (chocolate almond pastry) was $5.00. <br>Two cups of coffee cost another $5.00. <br><br>This is a place to patronize if the buyer has money to burn. We do not. <br><br>We wish them the best.

    	My favorite, humble little coffee shop in Richmond so far. The coffee is great, and the pastries are unique and tasty. The ladies behind the counter tells me many of the menu items are of Turkish origin...I&#39;m still working on pronouncing &#34;Pogaca&#34;! ^_^<br><br>My faves are the chocolate croissant and the spinach feta pie (I&#39;m sure there was another name for that, but I can&#39;t remember). It&#39;s always nice and flaky around the crust... mmm. I always request for the pastries to be toasted and it makes it taste so fresh, crispy, crumbly, and perfect with my coffee. Also I like to get a pogaca on the side...bread with cheese and dill, complimenting my spinach really well. I always walk out stuffed and way more full than I had intended to be.<br><br>Sometimes I come in on the weekend and they have a violinist playing live music. Love it!!

    	Enjoyed this little (very little) bakery in the Churchill neighborhood. We had a berry tart, a croissant, and cheese and berry pastry. All were fresh and delicious. For beverages, we tried a ginger beer, lavender and earl grey iced tea snd an iced coffee. <br><br>Only disappointments - bakery case was light on menu items and there were lots of flies around (not sure how to resolve that issue as they seem to love fresh pastries as much as we do!).

    	The croissants are HANDS DOWN the best I have eaten!  Crisp and flaky on the outside, moist and soft on the inside without feeling greasy at all.  That&#39;s just the foundation, though.  There are so many different types of croissants, and all of them are excellent (classic, chocolate, ham&amp;cheese, and my favorite, fig and cheese).  The fig and cheese croissant is by far my favorite mix of sweet and salty/savory.  The cheese has a nice nutty flavor against the sweet tartness of the fig.  And the mixture of textures with the crunchy/flaky croissant crust is AMAZING!<br><br>FYI, it gets busy in Saturday mornings, and different batches of pastries come out every half hour or so as needed.  So, just because that chocolate croissant isn&#39;t in the display case, doesn&#39;t mean it might not be cooking in the oven.  Just ask!

    	Sub Rosa Bakery is a wood-fire bakery and stone-milling operation located in the Church Hill neighborhood.  All the baked items that they make come from the wood fired masonry oven, using local ingredients, organic flour &amp; sugar, and housemade wheat/corn/rye.  How awesome is that?!  The menu is limited, offering croissants, pogaca, shortbread cookies, seasonal savory/fruit tarts, quiche, breakfast items, and an espresso bar.  The hubs and I came later in the day, and while I knew that most of the items weren&#39;t going to be available, it was still a little disappointing!  It seems as if the staff&#39;s automatic responses were that &#39;whatever is in the bakery case is what&#39;s available&#39; if you ask if a certain item would become available again, even after stating that you would wait.  Cat, who was manning the cash register, was the only one who actually went back to ask the &#39;bakers&#39; whether certain items would be ready.  Due to my active pressing, I was able to get a Pear with Orange Cream fruit tart (tart, but the &#39;orange cream&#39; was actually orange marmalade; I liked the crispy exterior crust, but probably opt for a savory tart the next time), a Pogaca (a Hungarian/Turkish/Albanian D-shaped bread pasty, filled with salty feta; the bread itself was crumbly and soft, and a great complement to the salty cheese within; I just wished these were warm) from the case, and a mini chocolate almond croissant (a little tough and a little dry, this was filled with a generous amount of chocolates and topped with a nice amount of slivered almonds) from the case.  I was told it would be about a 15-20 minute wait for the regular croissant, but the &#39;bakers&#39; had inaccurately estimated the time.  Instead, I opted for the freshly-baked Salami &amp; Cheese croissant, which was super MAGICAL.  The croissant was super flaky and buttery, and filled generously with sopressata slices and cheese - YUM!  I think this is literally one of the best salami &amp; cheese croissants I&#39;ve had, and probably one of my favorites of all time!  The place gets super packed, and there&#39;s limited seating as well (counter and some tables and armchairs).  I highly recommend in coming early in the morning for more varieties and for more right-out-of-the-oven goodies.  Limited parking off of 25th.<br><br>+Salami &amp; Cheese croissants :D :D :D<br>+Pogaca (when fresh)<br>+ask for Cat :D :D :D<br>+baked goods runs out quick!<br>+go early!<br>+limited free street parking off of 25th

Their coffees are strong which isn&#39;t my liking but it&#39;s no big deal. Make sure you come before 1pm because they sell out of pain au chocolat &amp; pain au chocolat et aux amandes (chocolate bread &amp; chocolate bread with almonds)! I seriously can&#39;t believe their baked goods are this amazing. I&#39;ll probably try their queche next time.

    	Sugar and Twine was my go-to coffee shop when I was living  in Richmond. It&#39;s a really cute place serving up coffee in beautiful mugs (love the little cortado mug) and a nice array of pastries. One of my absolute FAVORITE pastries in all of Richmond is their Maple Pecan Scone - so tender and flavorful! They also sell &#34;day old&#34; pastries at 50% off and they&#39;re just about as good as a fresh one after a quick reheat.<br><br>It&#39;s a nice place to read or do work (WiFi could be spotty at times but just ask staff to reset router). It&#39;s always bustling with customers but there are various seating options so just cozy up next to a neighbor and enjoy the lively atmosphere. Tip: Grab a seat by the window to people-watch the Carytown shoppers!

I grabbed lunch there with a friend today and got the fontina and cremini mushroom sandwich that was essentially a grilled cheese with mushrooms and it was pretty good but could have been a little more flavorful.My friend got the goat cheese and fig sandwich that she loved. Would definitely recommend stopping in on one of your Carytown outings!

    	I&#39;ve never been so emotional about a coffee shop, I mean why would I be? Walked in here because it was next to where my best friends and I were going to have dinner, but since there was a wait, i strolled in. This cafe is so cute yet modern with very simple decor. <br><br>So here&#39;s my story. I came in and was suggested an Almond Joy by this super sweet barista. Before she spoke to me, she served a homeless man named, George. She gave him a cup of water and asked if he was doing well. The relationship was so genuine and warmed my heart so I offered to buy him a baked good. She said that he does not speak but often comes in and asks for water. He smiled and quietly pointed to the blueberry bread. The barista said, he often looks hungry but doesn&#39;t demand anything besides water. I asked her to ring up another order of baked goods for tomorrow so he could have something to eat when he comes in. One thing he made me appreciate was how blessed I am to live the life I have. Something so simple like food, could warm someone&#39;s heart so much and no value of money could ever repay the gratitude he gave me with silence and a prolonged smile. <br><br>My Almond Joy: amazing! Their espresso isn&#39;t strong so it&#39;s just what I like! It was the perfect temperature and tasted so delicate........ so I&#39;m a happy camper. <br><br>My favorite place in Richmond

    	A very quiet cafe with a large selection of sweets to choose from. My friend and I both got iced chai tea lattes, which was paired greatly with almond milk. They&#39;re also vegan friendly which is something I liked. They don&#39;t have a lot of iced non coffee drinks but I did see that they had a variety of teas to choose from. I wish their drink menu was a little bit bigger but none the less they were still very satisfying.<br><br>I thought it the cafe would have been a little more busier considering how packed carytown was at the time, but that&#39;s something I actually like. If I still lived down here, I could definitely see myself spending my day at this cafe studying, getting coffee, meeting with friends, and etc.

    	Sugar &amp; Twine quickly became my go-to coffeeshop once it opened. All of the coffee drinks I&#39;ve tried so far have been spot on, the pastries look and taste amazing, and their breakfast biscuit sandwich is my favorite in Richmond. I&#39;ve noticed a lot of the same employees since they opened and they are always so friendly, even when there is a line out the door. Lately, its been pretty crowded and tough to find a seat, but the line always moves quickly so its always worth it. Such a cute coffeeshop and never disappoints!

    	This is a great addition to Carytown and a solid choice to grab a baked treat. Came to give this place a try recently with my friend. The interior of the place is nicely laid out and has a few places to sit, both with regular tables and a bar-like setup on the other side.<br><br>I had their unique oreo-styled cookie and it was delicious, not too sweet but with just the right consistency. They have something for everyone here, with &#34;vegan bombs&#34;, croissants, and blackberry biscuits galore. I will definitely be returning in the near future to try some of the other items here (including the sandwiches!), and with free Wi-Fi this would be a great place to set myself up to do some work if I want to get away from my place or campus for a while. Looking forward to my next trip here!<br><br>Overall: 4.0 stars<br>----------------<br>Pros:<br>- Good service.<br>- Warm and inviting interior and seating.<br>- Their pastries are delicious and very unique.<br>- Parking can be had nearby at one of Carytown&#39;s several lots/garages.<br><br>Cons:<br>- A little small, with some hits to cleanliness if it&#39;s busy or they&#39;re short-staffed.

    	Fantastic coffee-- they really take the time to hand craft each beverage. Maybe best iced latte I&#39;ve ever had. And their baked goods are to die for!

    	Great addition to Carytown! My cappuccino was wonderful and even came with a design in the froth even though it was in a to go. I enjoyed the free wifi in a bright ambiance with soft upbeat music in the background. I appreciated that they tried to make as much table space as possible. I will definitely be coming back to have a treat from the alluring bakery case which included unique items such as savory croissants.

    	I love this super cute cafe! The barista behind the counter was nice enough to suggest a delicious specialty coffee beverage called Dante&#39;s Purgatorio and he even made it less sweet like I asked. Overall, great coffee, great service, and an adorable spot! 10/10 recommend

    	I&#39;ve heard good things about the drinks here, so I didn&#39;t try one. Instead, I wondered if the sandwiches were worth it. I ordered a Caprese with bean salad, hoping that this classic panini would highlight my day.<br><br>My party received our order in about twenty minutes, and the Caprese surely made a pretty plate. For 9.25, I was looking for decent quality bread, tomatoes, and cheese. Tomatoes and mozz were fresh, as expected. The bread was disappointing, with an almost pudding-like interior contrasting with a cracker-like exterior. I was looking for an even subtle earthy flavor from the oregano, which was apparently included, but I failed to find it. As a whole, the sandwich lacked majorly in salt, resulting in a bland and borderline unappetizing meal. <br><br>The bean salad was also disappointing: oily, pepper and garlic overwhelming. I wish there was some acidity or more depth in flavor.<br><br>I will definitely be back to try a latte or other drink, but next time I will pass on the sandwiches. If I get a panini recommendation, I&#39;ll try it out and report back.

    	I go here often.  They have good food and coffee.  The muffins, scones, paninnis etc. are all very tasty.  The staff are always friendly.  There is a nice patio to sit on during good weather which is dog friendly.<br><br>But I really wish they&#39;d fix the front door.  The latch doesn&#39;t work right.  Plus since people are always walking out and leaving it open they need to install a auto-closing mechanism.  The place could use a few more power sockets too.

    	I stopped in on a lovely Sunday afternoon for a chai tea latte and a bite to eat. A+ for the ambiance; especially that large, inviting patio overlooking the hustle and bustle of Carytown. The latte was yummy and my panini with turkey, provolone, and pesto was just okay. The pesto didn&#39;t have that pop it usually does and tasted (gasp) store-bought. Ok I know I sound super picky and hard to please, but something just wasn&#39;t jiving for me. Overall though a cute little spot for a coffee or quick lunch. I&#39;ll definitely be back to lounge on that gorgeous patio or to check out their happy hour!

    	Cute cafe right in the heart of Carytown. Their paninis are amazing - warm, gooey, and buttery. The bean salad is on point too, fresh basil with red pepper. I had an iced coffee, which was a decent price. The lattes looked delicious with pretty designs, but they had a price tag to match. <br>I paid $14 (including tip) for a veggie panini and iced coffee... Worth it! <br><br>It is cramped inside but there are plenty of tables outside! And bring your laptop, there&#39;s wifi <br><br>5/5

I&#39;m usually not a fan of black teas with hints of fruit, but WOW it was so tasty. I had some iced coffee as well and it was so bold. I love it! I sat out in the sun and enjoyed their wonderful service. I would suggest this place to anyone looking for a wonderful place to have food and coffee.

    	Have been meaning to try 10 Italian Cafe and am so happy I finally did! It&#39;s the perfect place to get some work done or catch up with friends. They have a large patio that looks like it gets great sunlight -- dog friendly too!<br><br>My friend and I ordered lattes while figuring out what to order for food. The drinks tasted awesome and looked like works of art! A little on the expensive side -- they charge an extra dollar for almond milk, and my small latte came to four dollars. However, you do get a pretty big portion if you order in.<br><br>My friend ordered the salmon panini and thought it tasted great! Both of us raved about the bread they use -- it&#39;s perfectly crunchy while also super fresh and flavorful. I ordered the &#39;boscaiolo&#39;, a panini with oven-roasted turkey, truffle and provolone that was to die for...the cheese was perfectly gooey and melty. <br><br>Looking forward to coming back and trying more of their creative menu!

    	Brought to you by the same peeps that blessed us with Caffespresso,10 Italian Café rocks! <br><br>I spent a good portion of my day the other day working out of this cute shop. If you haven&#39;t already noticed, I love Caffespresso. The intimate atmosphere gets me every time. I&#39;m so happy that they managed to replicate that feeling in Carytown. Their attention to detail is all over the place; from the local artwork, to the plush sofas and the maps of the city underneath the tabletop glass. <br><br>I got... you guessed it... the chai tea latte. If you follow my reviews then you know that that&#39;s my jam. I gotta say that 10 Italian Café&#39;s version is definitely Lauri approved! It was perfectly frothy and flavorful. And that patio was to die for. The peoplewatching in Carytown is already top notch, but if you have a nice place to sit that makes it even better. I&#39;m definitely going to be setting up camp on that patio during the warmer months to soak up some rays!

    	Cozy little Italian cafe and coffeeshop in the heart of Carytown that offers free wifi and comfortable seating, including a nice-sized patio.<br><br>I stopped in to catch up on some work and was greeted by a chipper associate who handed me a menu.  I went with a basic ham and cheese panini and opted to have mixed greens as my side (as opposed to chips or bean salad, the other options).  I always appreciate when sandwich shops offer healthy alternatives for sides.  I really appreciated how genuinely friendly the associate was.  She wore a big smile and made polite conversation with me.<br><br>My coffee was served in a cute mug. A few minutes after taking my seat and opening my laptop my panini was brought to my table.  The bread on the panini was perfect!  Soft and warm on the inside with a nice crisp exterior.  I was happy that it wasn&#39;t overloaded with ham so that I could fully appreciate the yummy bread.  The greens were good and had some juicy tomato slices.  It was served with olive oil and vinegar.<br><br>The only downside was that prices were a bit steep.  The panini and coffee came to about $12 and the portions weren&#39;t that big.  Pros still definitely outweigh the slightly high prices, though!

    	Magestic coffee place considering they are so dog friendly! I also go here on the weekends after a family walk with my pup and grab a cup of warm or chilled coffee. Their coffee beans are from italy and the servers are always smiling (which is always nice to see). They also serve sandwhiches, teas and other goodies which I have yet to try. I usually go for their iced mochas but my roommates have tried practically everything on the menu and have never been dissapointed. Anyway, keeping this at a minimum -please try their coffee. It&#39;s not strong but it has such a nice texture, flavor and quality. I mean seriously, take the pup for a nice long walk and after enjoy a cup of coffee while enjoying a nice breeze on their outdoor patio, what&#39;s not to love?

    	The paninis were the bomb! I had the smoked salmon with artichoke spread. The bread was crunchy and unique. I also had the almond latte with almond milk and it was quality. I could&#39;ve done without the chocolate syrup, but it did make a beautiful latte. I will say it was a little pricey, but everything was of great quality and service was friendly. Serving the drinks in all sorts of different mugs made for a cute touch. This would be a great place to take a visitor!

    	I&#39;m a grad student and have searched high and low for the perfect venue to work at in RVA. I always come back to Stir Crazy! Not only do they have really good drip coffee (I think it&#39;s Ironclad), but their menu is also on point. My favorite thing on the menu is the Hermitage, which has grilled chicken, cheddar, bacon, and chipotle mayo. <br><br>In terms of ambience, Stir Crazy is great. I have never had a problem finding a seat, and there are plenty of outlets. The din is that of a normal coffee shop and the cafe is located in a quiet part of Bellevue. Overall, Stir Crazy comes strongly recommended!

    	I&#39;ve been here a handful of times now so I feel like I can give an honest review. <br><br>I usually get a cappuccino and a little something to snack on and let me say their coffee is fantastic and I&#39;ve never had bitter espresso from here (unlike some chain coffee places) which is something that I love. However, the baked goods definitely leave a lot to be desired as they tend to be dry and overly dense. The service is great and all of the baristas are friendly but not in an over the top way. <br><br>My favorite feature of this cafe is the decorations and seating. It has a giant hand done chalkboard menu and a really cool mural and the bar is repurposed wood. The seating here is nice as the have a plethora of options from cafe tables to cozy seats to the bar top and outside seating. I just love the atmosphere of this cute little shop. <br><br>Pros: atmosphere, variety, price, service, seating options, parking, clean bathrooms, wifi<br><br>Cons: when it&#39;s busy it&#39;s hard to find somewhere to sit, bakery items could be improved

    	As a coffee shop, this place is top notch.  As a cafe, it&#39;s good but not great; thus the four star rating instead of five.<br><br>I had a grilled sandwich with ham, cheese and apples.  I thought it was a very good sammich, but it cried for some dill pickles to cut through all the savory goodness.  They have regular chips (kettle fried!) which I had, and they&#39;re good, but my lunch-mate got the garlic bagel chips.  And the garlic bagel chips arethisclose to being worth committing homicide in order to obtain.<br><br>The coffee is very good.  I asked for their lightest roast, which was their house blend.  It was darker than I preferred, but was still a decent cuppa.  All in all, a sandwich and coffee set me back a little over ten bucks, which is probably average for this area.  If you&#39;re in the neighborhood, you have to stop by and check it out.<br><br>By the by, lots of chairs, wifi, etc etc etc, all the stuff you&#39;ve come to expect from a coffee shop.  So don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re covered.

	UPDATE, went today and was planning just a coffee but order a sandwich with red skin potato salad.  Sandwich this time was good fair amount of ham and cheese great flavor, coffee is always good.  Today was a surprise considering my last visit was a total loss.  As for the potato salad, get chips instead, more red onion than potato.  Staff was very courteous and friendly.

    	My husband and I decided to take a break from the scorching heat at the Richmond Botanical Garden and come here for lunch. I am glad we did! The coffee was amazing, food was very fresh with lots of healthy choices (unless you are ordering a pastry), and the atmosphere was very homey. They have couches with mismatched tables and chairs and tons of reading materials. I got the tuna melt with a side salad which had a interesting berry vinaigrette. My husband got a breakfast burrito which was hearty, but not too greasy. We live in Philadelphia so hard to return, but we will definitely recommend this cafe/coffee shop to friends who live in Richmond.

    	This is the neighborhood cafe I wish I had in every neighborhood I&#39;ve lived in. The ambience is great, the owner and staff are very friendly, and the delicious menu turned me into a regular. I&#39;ve had pretty much everything on the menu, and there is nothing I don&#39;t recommend, but I&#39;ll list some of my favorites: <br><br>American Breakfast Wrap - the seasoning on the potatoes makes this<br><br>Greycourt sandwich - big fan of their homemade guacamole <br><br>Newport sandwich - like a blue cheese encrusted steak in a sandwich<br><br>Tuna Melt or Clinton - delicious tuna salad recipe. Not soaked in mayo like most tuna salads<br><br>Salads - huge and fresh and good quality<br><br>Paninis - Mount Vernon and Rachel Reuben are my favorites <br><br>Sides - redskin potato salad and mediterranean pasta salad (add goat cheese!) are my favorites<br><br>I should note that I&#39;m not a coffee drinker, although people seem to really like it here. They did get me to start drinking dirty chais though, which I am now a fan of. I really don&#39;t have anything negative to say about Stir Crazy - enjoy!

    	I stopped into this cafe because I was at an event on this street and was starving. I had no expectations and I can say that this adorable cafe exceeded any judgments that I had from the outside before I walked in. They have a wonderful sandwich menu that is written on a wall with chalk but looks more like an artistic mural take on a menu. They also serve breakfast everyday which is a big WIN for me! I ordered the original breakfast wrap which was egg, cheese, peppers, onions, and sausage and it was FANTASTIC!<br><br>I stopped in on a busy day because a festival was going on but they had plenty of staff working and I watched them be accommodating to customers over and over even though they were quite busier than normal. They even let me know up front that orders were a little backed up which I appreciated. All in all Stir Crazy can&#39;t do anything better in my eyes. It&#39;s a great alternative to a fast food chain, good fresh food, adorable ambiance and decor, and great service. Did I mention they have local beer too!

    	I kept seeing this place on Groupon and fellow Yelpers have all reviewed it. Finally I had a desire to go try a new cafe where I could sit and study, since I normally pick my home or library over cafes. Went onto Groupon and within an hour was at Stir Crazy ordering a meal. I decided to have the Mt. Vernon panini: Grilled chicken breast filet, bacon, swiss, pesto, served on ciabatta bread. That was a fatty piece of chicken breast. I was also able to pick a side with my panini, so I decided to try their coleslaw. Very good meal. I stayed at Stir Crazy for about two hours so I dragged out my meal, and the panini was good when it was pipin&#39; hot and cool. I also had a large chai tea latte, which came out in an enormous mug. I wasn&#39;t expecting the amount of foam that I received, but it&#39;s like they could read that I&#39;m a foam lover. The drink was great, and I dragged it out too, just like my meal. To reach the full value of my Groupon, I also ordered a chocolate muffin. You could tell by the taste that this wasn&#39;t a mass production, factory made type of muffin that you get in a pack at Food Lion. I took most of my muffin home and my husband, who is not a chocolate fan, really enjoyed it. <br>The whole time I sat at one of the tables up front, by the window. Lots of people came in and out, and while the place is loud, I and a few others were about to focus in our work. I think the large size of the establishment helps. <br>I really enjoyed sitting at a cafe and will probably try to come back again.

    	Hmmmmm......I really wanted to like this place.  It has good reviews and is in a decent location relative to where I live.  I was surprised at how big it is when I initially walked in.  It seems like a trendy little spot where people come to get coffee and work on their laptops.  There was a small group of women knitting in the corner.  I&#39;m not a coffee drinker but it looks like they have a nice selection.  The woman who took my order wasn&#39;t very friendly- she didn&#39;t seem thrilled to be there.  I believe I got the Hermitage Panini.  It was tasty and came out super hot but the bread was pretty hard.  The pasta salad side was incredibly small.  Lunch was enjoyable, but I feel like I made a rush decision.  The menu is written on a chalkboard wall and it was awkward trying to read the whole thing with people sitting in front of it thinking that I was staring at them.  I&#39;d like to give this place another try and see if I have a more memorable experience.

    	For two parents who are not morning people with an active morning toddler, this place was just the spot we needed! We were in town for a wedding that didn&#39;t start until late afternoon - so we were on the hunt for a place we could wake up and let the three year old run off some early morning energy. It&#39;s a cute little coffee shop in a strip mall with a quaint, family friendly atmosphere. The children&#39;s play area was awesome - clean, with all kinds of toys for kiddos, and it&#39;s closed in, so you don&#39;t have to worry about the kiddos running off. There was an entire wall of adult coloring book pages, a take one-leave one paperback book library, and some games. They are also clearly hooked into local issues - looked like they were in the middle of a winter clothing drive.<br><br>I ordered a special RVA tea blend - it was dark and sort of sweet, but hit the spot waking up. We also got a couple breakfast sandwiches - these were pretty good for a small shop, bagels were decent and the egg/bacon wasn&#39;t bad. Definitely a step up from a Panera or the like. They had a couple little displays out that looked like samples, but don&#39;t screw up like I did! They aren&#39;t samples -- just not clearly marked as for sale. When we came in, it wasn&#39;t busy, but after about an hour the place was packed with other parents doing the same thing we were. If we were local, we&#39;d probably visit here a lot more often. It&#39;s hard to find places you can comfortably take your kiddo without worrying about it being annoying to other customers.

    	Whenever I&#39;m in town visiting my parents, I stop by Perk! for a coffee and scone or other sweet treat. There really aren&#39;t any other coffee options nearby, but I&#39;m glad that this place is so good. Their scones and breakfast sandwiches are really delicious, and their coffee (both hot and iced) is tasty. My only complaint is that they can be a little slow sometimes, but everyone I have encountered who works there is very nice and helpful. <br><br>When the weather is nice, it&#39;s great to walk there, and it has a small town neighborhood feel. Having grown up in Bon Air, I&#39;m rooting for the area to stay alive and thrive, and I think Perk is doing a lot to help with that!

    	We were heading to Williamsburg to meet up with my brother in law&#39;s family so we figured we should check Perk out on the way as I never realized this was a spot until recently. <br><br>I was pleasantly surprised! The service was fairly quick for a coffee shop. My husband got a Pumpkin Spice Latte (I took a sip of it... ahmazing... man it probably better than Starbucks.  I guess any coffee tastes good to me since I&#39;m not drinking any now, as I stopped drinking fru fru coffee drinks when I found out I was pregnant), wonder if they have a gingerbread latte... I&#39;d love to try that.<br><br>Originally I was going to get a Bacon, Egg and Cheese on an everything bagel... but when I saw the Breakfast Tarts (Asparagus, baked egg, havarti, Parmesan, bacon, salad burnet [had to look up what this was... learned a new term... kind of looks like cilantro... without the cilantro taste... though I&#39;m going to have to buy some to try so I know what the exact taste is] on puff pastry, all I can say is that it is super yummy and makes me want to make them at home. Let&#39;s be real though anything puff pastry is usually pretty darn good, though it would&#39;ve been better if they stuck it in the oven longer. Point to note, not something you want to eat in the car though as puff pastry can be messy.), I decided I had to try one. My husband also got one and a Sausage, Egg and Cheese on everything bagel (very good... they use Cupertino bagels so super flavorful... I think they buy pre-made egg patties though... it would&#39;ve been better if it wasn&#39;t. My daughter enjoyed the other half.) <br><br>We couldn&#39;t help ourselves and got some baked goods too an Orange Scone with a spider web drawn on it (very tasty though they should&#39;ve used the same glaze they used for the orange glaze to design the spiderweb instead of edible gel... as that would&#39;ve kept it from being Sticky), and two Salted Chocolate Chip cookies (love the salty sweet combo... my daughter ate a whole one by herself as a snack later during the day). <br><br>I didn&#39;t realize it was down the street from Gelati Celesti and right in the same shopping center at Joe&#39;s Inn. I&#39;ll have to frequent this place a little more often, and have a seat in the coffee shop. Seems like a nice place to relax as there were a good bit of seats.

    	Ugh. What a disappointment. I met a friend after a medical procedure, and carried in my cup of coffee from the Dr&#39;s office. My intent was to finish the cup and order from the coffee clerk. Before I could finish, the clerk approached me and on a loud aggressive tone told me not to bring outside food into the store. She did say she&#39;d allow not this time but not the next time I come back. <br>I dont mind being told that, it was just the manner in which Iwas told. And the aggeeasion. This place bills it self as a tolerant, accepting venue..  I feel too uncomfortable to go back. I don&#39;t recommend it at all.

    	I needed a pick me up and decided to check Perk out! I love the branding and have been following them on various social media platforms for awhile now. It&#39;s a fairly large coffee shop with adorable yellow metal chairs. The staff was really friendly and I ordered a hazelnut mocha and a banana chocolate chip muffin- both delicious. There&#39;s a kids&#39; play area in the back, and lots of yummy food like scones, sea salt chocolate chip cookies, and more. Love it!

    	My neighborhood coffee shop! Perk is so much more than that - it is an amazing gathering place for community and friends and is quickly becoming the go-to location for everything important happening in the Richmond area. Did I mention the coffee? It&#39;s fantastic. I&#39;m addicted to latte&#39;s, and they have the best ever! Their service is always quick and super friendly and they&#39;re happy to chat about whatever&#39;s on your mind.<br>If you&#39;re passing through, don&#39;t miss it. If you&#39;re lucky enough live in the area - put it on your regular visit list. You will NOT be disappointed.

    	Great location! Great coffee! Plus a play area and some high chairs. <br><br>I was headed to a mama play date and needed a quick place to stop with my kiddos to grab a snack. Even though they&#39;d lost power from a storm, they still had lots of yummy goodies to sell. My kids had some yummy chocolate chip scones and whole milk. I had a regular cappuccino. And it was just perfect. <br><br>The kids played in the well-stocked, well-sized play area for a few minutes before we sat down to eat our snack. There were high chairs that I could have used for my toddler, but he sat pretty well on the bench seat, so I didn&#39;t use one. <br><br>If we lived in the area, we&#39;d definitely be back!

    	I come here every Sunday for my weekly &#34;I made it&#34; treat.  Love the flavor combos for the pastries and sandwiches (lemon Rosemary muffins, orange ricotta scones, the beautiful breakfast tarts, and pimento cheese because PIMENTO CHEESE).  The coffee is the best in south-side IMHO, and the cream art just adds to the artistic charm of the coffee shop itself.   <br>What I like most is that while the menu features options with complex flavors that I personally enjoy, this is totally a kid-friendly shop, with dinosaur-shaped cheese sandwiches and almond butter-chocolate-banana sandwiches for the little ones.

	Update: I visited Perk! again this morning. I EASILY and EFFICIENTLY bought a bag of coffee from the &#34;shop&#34; section of the store, and I also got a delicious (and beautiful) latte, smiles, and cheerful greetings - DESPITE the customer in front of me being totally awful to your staff. I was impressed with their resilience and handling of the situation. <br>THANK YOU for listening to my feedback!

    	This is a great place to bring the family for morning breakfast and coffee.  Our girls had fun in the playroom in the back while I enjoyed my coffee, adult coloring picture wall, and writing on fabric what 5 words describe my life.  The pour over coffee was delicious and the latte was the perfect temperature to enjoy immediately.

    	This is a great local coffee shop!  The service is speedy and friendly, and supports other local businesses too.  But, as a mom of a toddler, I cannot say enough about their play space!  It is full of clean, working toys, and is in a contained area.  It makes a coffee date with another mom possible and enjoyable.  The food and coffee are also delicious!

    	A kid friendly coffee shop?! I had never heard of such a thing until I went to Perk! Walking in, you would think it&#39;s just a typical coffee shop but if you keep walking back here is a gated off kid&#39;s corner that is fill with toys, books and a chalk board. It was very tidy and had chairs for the parents so they could relax and enjoy their drinks while their children could freely roam the kid area. I was very impressed with it and will be back soon!

    	I want to like Perk. I really do. They kept the play area from the fro-yo place that was previously there: that is great news for parents  with small children. I get it. However, I am over my Cartwheels and Coffee days, so listening to kids scream and carry on in the play area while I try to chat over a cup of coffee doesn&#39;t do much for me. <br><br>Seating is limited. Coffee is good. Lines don&#39;t move too swiftly. <br><br>I will give them a few more tries because I do like to support local businesses. Maybe they still have some kinks to work out.

    	I love walking here to grab a Friday morning treat. Get the mocha with half sugar and you will not go wrong--or the almond milk latte. The staff here are really nice, funny, and great at what they do. If you&#39;re feeling frisky go ahead and get a bacon &amp; cheese scone. I&#39;m eager to try their pour over coffee next. It looks heavenly.<br><br>The atmosphere here is a little sterile (HA! The Lab! I get it now), but there&#39;s always cool art on the walls to look at while you&#39;re waiting to get caffeinated. Although I&#39;ve always taken my stuff to go, it seems like a nice place to hang out with a few friends, or bring your work and chill for a while.

    	I ordered the hot cocoa and a chocolate chip cookie. The service was friendly and prompt. The ambiance was laid back and chill. Unfortunately, the cookie was overly browned and hard, but still an okay cookie, and the cocoa was more like warm milk than hot chocolate and could use more cocoa.<br><br>IMHO, this place usually has amazing coffee with awesome service and the owner is super friendly, so I&#39;ll give it another try before I write off the cocoa and cookies.

    	So to be super clear up front; the harsh star rating has nothing to do with the people or what they are serving... It&#39;s solely a value proposition -based rating and their proximity to so many other coffee shop options.  I&#39;m certain if there were not soooo many options around here, I would not be so tough.<br><br>The staff are really great! and ultimately the coffee they are serving is ok.<br><br>I didn&#39;t pay much attention to what their espresso drinks cost, but for brewed coffee, my knowledge, this is the most expensive regular coffee of any coffee shop in town.<br>$2.25; 2.75; 3.25 per cup... Yikes...<br><br>Yes, I know it&#39;s only a couple bucks but still... When you think in terms of percentages; this is like 20-30% higher than any competitor anywhere in the city... In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve never paid this area coffee shop even in New York City.<br><br>That said if it was some super stupendous brew; I could probably overlook the $$$$$ price, but for me, it wasn&#39;t.  The day I went, featured some extremely acidic brew that; at least for my pallet; was not great... That said, it&#39;s like art right.... Someone else might think it&#39;s awesome.  Again which is what made feel like I got ripped.<br><br>Computer friendliness...  Not so much.  Not a single power outlet in the place and rather than having their own wifi; they apparently use the Comcast Hot spot network... That is fine if your a Comcast customer but otherwise not so much.<br><br>Perhaps the intent on the power &amp; wifi is to not encourage people parking themselves for hours... But you can accomplish the same thing by setting up your wifi to boot people off after 1/2 hour... Pretty easy to do.<br><br>So again... If this were the only place around, perhaps I wouldn&#39;t be so harsh on my rating, but when you have 6 options within a 6 block radius... well, I don&#39;t know... Tough not to be tough.

    	This place is made for coffee connoisseurs. If you do not appreciate coffee in different styles other than just loaded with sugar and flavoring you will not like this place. It stays true to the cold brew process and completes the coffee with care.

    	The coffee here is excellent. It was one of the best lattes I&#39;ve ever had. I walked in and there was literally noone else there so it was kinda awkward, but I managed to sneak a glimpse at some of the art hanging up. It&#39;s kinda like being in a fancy iPhone. It took this side of forever for them to make my latte and it was pretty small for the price but it was so excellent when they were done that I would definitely go back.

    	I went here with my friend from Philadelphia. She works at a bakery up there and is very particular about her chai lattes, so when she had one, she was beyond happy (she ended up ordering two)!<br>We also ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit and that was honestly one of the best I&#39;ve ever had. The biscuit was so moist and thick, that even a couple hours later, when we ate it again (cold), it was still buttery and delicious. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants good coffee, calm atmosphere, and light meals. Will come back for their pastries!

    	Due to the fact that my body can&#39;t handle high levels of caffeine (I get the shakes, can&#39;t concentrate, and start to sweat), I have recently transformed from a casual coffee drinker into a tea lover. Specifically chai tea. I&#39;m happy to say that Alchemy does chai, and they do it well.    <br><br>I strolled in on a lovely Sunday afternoon needing a quick pick-me-up. I immediately loved the ambiance and felt like this was a place that I could definitely see myself coming to relax. The playlist was just right, employees were super helpful, and the crowd, which seemed to be composed of VCU students, was mellow. When ordering my chai tea latte, I went with almond milk instead of whole or soy milk. This was probably the best decision that I made all day because what resulted was a perfectly crafted, fresh, sweet, yet spicy drink with an ever, ever so slight nutty flavor. Even the boyfriend, who does not delight in coffee or hot tea, liked it and commented that it &#34;tasted like cinnamon&#34;. Well, my dear, that&#39;s what chai tea is supposed to taste like! <br><br>What I enjoy most about The Lab, however, is their story. They set themselves apart from other coffee shops in many ways- especially by emphasizing the scientific process of making their customers the perfect cup of joe. I am a huge supporter and admirer of businesses that stand out from the crowd and deliver unique produces/services. Their passion is evident even to the most casual patron. <br><br>Community is another central aspect of The Lab. With walls lined with VCU student artwork and a local company, Maven Made, repurposing their used beans to make face and body scrubs, Alchemy is all about spreading the local love. <br><br>Go here. You won&#39;t be disappointed!

    	I&#39;m still just in awe of Alchemy and their commitment to all things coffee! Their staff are passionate about coffee...it&#39;s not just a job for them.  I&#39;ve been here twice, once on my own and once as part of a Yelp event, and I was blown away both times. I learned something for my own home &#34;lab&#34; each time and, though I&#39;m still trying to match the quality of their brew, I&#39;m getting closer. They even offered to help me dial in my process by bringing my home equipment to go through the motions and see what steps I can improve. I haven&#39;t done it yet, but it&#39;s in the future plans. <br><br>The atmosphere is bright, comfortable and has a good, almost Portland-like vibe, with a steady stream of students.  They&#39;ll make you virtually any kind of coffee beverage the right way, and explain what they&#39;re doing along the way. They also have a variety of good foods, baked and otherwise. <br><br>Parking is the only challenge, but they&#39;re even lobbying for improvements in that area. Despite their downtown location, it is possible to find a parking space in the neighborhood, even if you get to enjoy a nice stroll to reach the front door. <br><br>I don&#39;t know what else to say except go!

    	I spent my first weekend in the Richmond area recently, and made a stop by Alchemy since it looked like a nice little spot and I was craving the blueberry muffin mentioned by another reviewer. The pastries are as good as advertised and I enjoyed it while sitting in their nice sunny window and watching the Broad St traffic go by. But what really made me want to write this review was the staff that lead to the single best coffee I&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>I&#39;ll openly admit to being a coffee novice, so when I walked in to order my drink I basically threw myself on the mercy of the cashier. She was friendly and eager to help me puzzle out what it was I actually wanted and I decided on a simple latte. It was rich, flavorful, not bitter in the slightest, and beautiful. The staff was friendly from when we walked into the door until we left and I absolutely can&#39;t wait to go back and try another of their suggestions the next time I&#39;m in the area. While I can&#39;t speak to the rest of their menu, the constant stream of regulars really speaks for itself.

Since it was a rainy morning I went with a hot chocolate... a hazelnut dark hot chocolate to be exact! It was delicious, I find myself craving it every once in a while. <br><br>It is a cute shop perfect for an afternoon of work or a girls meet up! I will definitely be back to visit and try new things.

The staff was really nice too, all in all I had a wonderful experience.<br><br>To drink got their infamous birthday cake latte, to eat the sunrise polenta. Both my latte and breakfast were very good. The latte was adorable with sprinkles and it was sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. My breakfast polenta was a little too much polenta for one egg. It did have some really nicely sauteed peppers diced in there too though. If I could change one thing it would be to add another egg and give me a bit less polenta. The polenta taste itself was the perfect amount of spicy goodness. I would love to try their other breakfast offerings because everything seemed really yummy in there!

    	Greenbriar is something special. When you want to be wow&#39;d by your coffee, head over. One time during spring I stopped in for a honey lavender violet latte called the Bee&#39;s Meadow or something...delicious. In the fall I stopped by and tried an Apple Cobbler latte....sensational. In the winter I tried a peppermint patty latte. Always hits the seasonal spot! I&#39;ve had an egg and cheese sandwich here and it was yummy, and luckily they had live jazz that day. More of their food needs to be tried, but the drinks have captured my coffee loving heart.

	Updating my review after having become a more seasoned coffee snob.<br><br>As always, Greenbriar is guaranteed to be very cozy and without snobbishness that might come with other coffee shops. (You know what I mean.)<br><br>The food here is much more satisfying than at other coffee shops in the area and everything I&#39;ve tried here is delicious. You can&#39;t really go wrong with one of their bagels or sandwiches. The sunrise polenta is also great, but only order it if you have time since it may take longer for them to cook.<br><br>I will say that the drinks here are on the sweeter side. I generally prefer to drink black coffee, but Greenbriar is the place to get my fix if I&#39;m in the mood for a sweet, sweet latte. In this case, I highly recommend the birthday cake latte or the almond chai latte! <br><br>The birthday cake latte is sweet and delicious and unique to Greenbriar. The rainbow nonpareil sprinkles can&#39;t help but make you smile. The almond chai latte has a sweet artificial almond flavor that pairs nicely with the chai. I mean artificial in a good way! I grew up eating almond jello (a Filipino dessert) and the flavor of the latte is reminiscent of that. <br><br>My only issue is that sometimes they end up giving me a latte where the coffee or espresso tastes a bit burnt, but it&#39;s generally not too off-putting! <br><br>Greenbriar is also the best coffeeshop in the area to get some studying done. It&#39;s quiet, tucked away, and has wifi and outlets available. (Forget about Starbucks!)<br><br>Overall, VCU students are really fortunate to have great cafes like Greenbriar only walking distance from campus!

    	I came here as a stop on the Real Richmond Food Tour. The food sampled was just ok.  But I&#39;m here to tell you about the Chai Tea they served. <br>Ahmazing! !!!  It was creamy, warm and all types of yummy. Super smooth like the best I ever had.  When asked to buy some, they advised they&#39;re waiting for the shipment to arrive.  Omg total bummer.  When something Is that good, please keep it in stock. <br>The set up is cute inside and I understand it&#39;s a husband and wife team running this establishment. <br>I can&#39;t comment on the food much, but those present on the food tour with me seemed to enjoy the eats. <br>I&#39;d recommend you come here for the Chai, really it is awesome! <br><br>Enjoy | Have fun :)

    	Fantastic, cozy little cafe! I always make sure to visit when I&#39;m dropping off or picking up prints at Uptown Color. This cafe wasn&#39;t here when I was a student at VCU, but the students are very fortunate to have this place within walking distance of campus. Customer service is always top notch, and the quality of the food and coffee is consistent and never fails. Tons of unique flavor combinations for the sandwiches and salads, along with interesting latte flavors [the birthday cake latte and rose chai latte, for example]. They also serve all day breakfast, a huge plus!<br><br>I usually get a latte or cappuccino when I stop by, but today, I saw that they had a &#34;stuffed roll&#34; with smoked gruyere, ham, and leeks. The chef makes random baked goods from scratch daily, and oh goodness, this one hit the mark.<br><br>Definitely a place to check out if you&#39;re in the area and need a new cafe to lounge at. If this place was around when I was a student 6+ years ago, I definitely would&#39;ve been an every day regular.

    	They have the best breakfast sandwiches in town hands down. Try their bacon and egg everything bagels! They also have a good selection of lunch menu items like the Main Street BLT, which comes with avocado! I usually get my sandwiches with a cup of seasonal fruit. This is a slight up-charge, but you can get it with either chips or a side salad for no extra cost. If you&#39;re in the mood for something hot, take a look at their selection of hot teas/coffee. They also have great hot chocolate options, and I HIGHLY recommend their  lavender white hot chocolate. It&#39;s a shame they aren&#39;t open on weekends because I would love to come here more often.

	The best breakfast spot in Richmond Va. Fast heart service. Plenty of seats avail. Parking avail on street. Food is freshly made every day . Custom dishes are never a problem. I&#39;ve been going for years and they never disappoint with anything I&#39;ve wanted. Keep up the great work.

    	I stopped by Greenbriar Cafe and Coffeehouse for a quick lunch. I got Greenbriar Cafe specialty sandwich of the day. It was a pizza steak sub (Italian beef, pepperoni, mozzarella, peppers, onions, &amp; tomato sauce) with potato chips. All of the ingredients blended well together. The sub was very flavorful and delicious. Greenbriar Café pizza steak is one of the best subs I&#39;ve eaten in Richmond.  This sub should definitely be a regular menu item. I didn&#39;t try any coffee here but Greenbriar has a variety of coffee flavors. The ambience is perfect for relaxing. There&#39;s street parking in front of Greenbriar Café. I give Greenbriar Cafe and Coffeehouse a 4.5 rating. I&#39;ll update my review once I try Greenbriar coffee.

    	This place is awesome! Another one of those blink-and-you&#39;ll-miss-it spots in the Fan. Man, let me tell you. VCU students are lucky to have as many awesome local businesses footsteps away from campus. <br><br>It is so much bigger on the inside than it seems from the outside. It&#39;s bright, open, and filled with people from all different walks of life. When I was there, there was a steady flow of traffic. Although the salads and sandwiches looked amazing, I was craving pizza that day, so I just settled for coffee and decided I&#39;d eat lunch there next time. <br><br>I went to order my usual, a chai tea latte, but I was surprised that they had a lot of different types of chai lattes! I ultimately chose the almond flavor made with nonfat milk. At first gulp, it was incredible! But after that? Not so much. It tasted like diabetes in a cup. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn&#39;t finish it. The thing about it is that the flavor was awesome. I can&#39;t put my finger on it, but it didn&#39;t really remind me of almonds. It was still really good. However, the sweetness that sort of surrounded the flavor was overbearing. Such a shame! <br><br>Maybe if it were a little more diluted, it would have been better. Regardless, I&#39;m already ready to go back to Greenbriar and try another drink and salad!

    	I stopped here to grab a chai and read a book. The chai was really good, tasted like it might be Oregon Chai because of the honey flavor, but I didn&#39;t pay attention when they made it so I don&#39;t really know what it was. Really nice location to walk around and stop in for a drink. I didn&#39;t get a chance to try their food items but they had a lot of delicious sounding things on the menu!

    	Should you happen upon this understated establishment, peer in and you should find a cozy cafe filled with the delicious aroma of food and coffee. Greenbriar is filled with plenty of seating, fast wifi, and a an ambience of college/graduate students mixed with professors. Food is quite good, but the caffeine even better. <br><br>The eats/drinks:<br>1. Birthday cake latte: sweet and amazingly good, topped with sprinkles. Yums<br>2. Breakfast sandwich: my choice consisted of a sausage patty with egg between two croissants and a side of fruit (apples and grapes). <br><br>Private parking is out back. Just make sure to ask for a free permit from the cashier first. Looking forward to coming back for some of that delicious latte.

    	Order the steak bistro sandwich. It&#39;s delicious! I had this delivered to my apt. It took a while to arrive but it was worth the wait.

    	Vising Richmond on business, and decided to stop in this quaint little coffee shop for a cup of coffee. I immediately fell in love with this charming little shop right outside of the VCU campus. The atmosphere is very relaxed, and not pretentious like some other shops I&#39;ve been. There are plenty of seating options, and not overly crowded. <br><br>I decided to order the Raw Vanilla  latte with soy milk. The drink was delicious! I meant to ask for no foam, so I did find it to be a little too foamy. But that is more my fault than theirs. I also decided to order the granola w/ fruit and yogurt. The total came to around $11.50, which was a little pricey. However, i don&#39;t mind supporting local businesses. The yogurt was nothing to write home about, and the fruit on top was a random assortment of grapes, apples, and what I&#39;m assuming was a plum. However the granola was fantastic! <br><br>One other note, as previously mentioned by another reviewer, the wait for the food can be a little long. So I would definitely say that you should come here and expect to relax. This is not Fast Food!

	Pricing is odd. A bagel with flavored cream cheese is $5.25 - more than most of the bagel sandwiches with more ingredients. Also, they will never have skim milk.

    	A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  Stopped in for lunch, today, and must share with everyone that my entire experience was perfect!  Decided to try the Bistro Beef sandwich with side salad ($7.95). Delish! My sandwich was piled high with piping hot, succulent beef, caramelized onions, and tangy horseradish sauce. Being a girl that love sauce...I should have asked for more because it made the sandwich. Then, I asked for the &#34;house&#34; salad dressing, which turned out to be this bright, creamy avocado concoction that should be bottled and sold. I will attempt to upload a photo to share the love of this plate of yummy goodness!  I will definitely return to try another creation, which I discovered is all made  &#34;from scratch&#34; from the sauces to the roast of beef. Did I say, &#34;Succulent?!?&#34; My sandwich was a succulent success.

    	So after a long day of training, my colleagues and I wanted some lunch and a bit of pick me up.  So our friend suggested this quaint establishment near VCU campus.  <br><br>As mentioned before, one would miss the cafe if they blinked while passing by.  Once you get in though, there&#39;s plenty of tables with about 4 or less per table.  Since we had a party of 6, we just combined two tables and the establishment didn&#39;t say anything so hopefully they were okay with it :D<br><br>They have a pretty extensive menu and serve breakfast all day.  I ordered the fan which consisted of turkey, avocado, veggies, cheese, and mayo on toasted wheat.  I also had a side salad with honey mustard.  The sandwich itself tasted good (like any ol&#39; turkey sandwich).  However, since the bread was toasted, the roof of my mouth was a bit scratched up.  Salad was good but they only give you like a dollop of dressing...the dressing itself was good as it had a tad of heat to it.  <br><br>I also got lavender lemon which was very refreshing...yes it is lemonade with lavender.  Just be careful at the bottom as you will get lavender in your mouth if you are a texture person.  <br><br>All in all, cute establishment.  They have games for you to play and just chill.  Lots of people just chilling and working.
