    	Whenever I see a Catina picture I squeal. Not a girlie squeal, but like. OK maybe a little girlie. Anyway, let&#39;s get on with the actual review.<br><br>What to get: Avocado Smoothie!<br>What else: I&#39;ll tell you more After-cardio (get it, Avo-cado).<br><br>The folks working here were Latino, and super friendly. They made me an exceptional avocado smoothie for next to no money at all (under $3 if I recall). It&#39;s not the best I&#39;ve ever had (that might be at New Dong in Boston, yes that&#39;s a real thing lol), but between the lovely service and the good taste in a state with not much great Asian dessert-and-drink option, I&#39;m happy to give this lovely little Vietnamese place a 5.<br><br>And if you just came from a Cantina and want to wash down your food, try an Avocado smoothie at Catina!

	***so it seems this place had closed down for about a week or so to do some cleaning, it&#39;s pretty clean in here now, also I haven&#39;t seen the regular owners in a bit only the two ladies that help out. BTW the bahn mi was soo much better today than usual, these ladies are something else plus they were so kind! Normally I feel like I&#39;m an inconvenience to ask questions about the pre maid dishes but she was actually eager to help me.***<br><br>MSoooo happy I decided to come here after getting pho at Tay Do! Now I love this place even tho they have the most random hours and cold employees but none of that mattered this visit! There were so many people working today and they all actually paid attention to me when I entered the store (this is a first!) today I got a coconut bubble tea (originally wanted avocado but when I ordered she let me know they were out of avocados) oh well I love coconut just as much! The atmosphere was just different today!

    	I agree with the overall rating of 3.5 stars. Catina is just a-ok. <br><br>Pros: <br>-The price. For 3.75 you can get any Vietnamese sandwich you want. That&#39;s an awesome deal. Also, if for some reason you need 6 sandwiches, buying 5 sandwiches will get you one for free!<br>-Cantina is probably the only place in Richmond where you can get the large variety of banh mis to satisfy any craving.<br><br>Cons: <br>-Horrible, horrible customer service. To be fair, Catina isn&#39;t a restaurant so they just want customers to come in, order then leave. With that said, the workers are not friendly. <br>-CASH ONLY. I almost exclusively use plastic for all of my purchases. I would definitely frequent this place more often if they accept card. <br><br>Overall, the sandwiches are pretty good with a great price tag. I would definitely recommend this place if you are craving a banh mi but don&#39;t go out of your way to try it.

    	I like the banh mis here! And would return probably anytime I&#39;m craving one when I&#39;m in Richmond.<br><br>However it kind of stresses me out when I come here. There seems to never be anyone at the cash register when you go in.. they&#39;re probably doing some work in the back, which is fine, but there&#39;s a big wall blocking the view to the back, and I don&#39;t feel comfortable shouting to the back... So there is usually a wait for someone to come to you.<br><br>Also they didn&#39;t seem to understand me when I asked for more condensed milk in my vietnamese iced coffee. It was so bitter so I asked my vietnamese friend to talk to them. They said something along the lines that they can&#39;t because it&#39;s already mixed and cold. I think that&#39;s kind of silly to not accommodate. That was too bad; I ended up throwing most of it away.

    	There really is a lack of Bahn Mi places in Richmond,  so Catina is my go-to when I am in the mood for a Grilled Pork Bahn-Mi. The rolls are amazing and baked in house. For under 4.00 you just can&#39;t beat it! Id give this 5 stars, but from time to time the sandwich can be a bit salty. Still delicious, but keep me from giving the extra star.

    	When you walk in this store, omg the smells are all so good. I&#39;m not even viet and I don&#39;t even know what was cooking back there but I think that the main thing I was smelling was the bread and it smelled so fresh. <br><br>Their food, in my opinion deserves a 4. I got the grilled pork and pork belly band mi and I really liked it! The bread was a softer than crispy but I liked that. It still had a bit of crunchiness and chewiness in it. I&#39;m just not the type of person who likes to eat the super hard kind of baguette that hurts your gums, but hey that&#39;s just me. <br><br>Prices are excellent. Cheapest banh mis ever. Each one is 3.75 and it&#39;s like a full on sandwich! <br><br>The reasons why I marked down two stars is <br>1. Their service was just not it. The man behind the counter worked at suchhh a slowww pace, taking his sweet little time to come from the back and take my order. He looked like he hated life, hated me, and just looked unhappy. Harshed my vibe. <br>2. This place needs a sit down place, maybe even outside or something. I feel like more people would come if they did. <br>3. The food that they make in the store and sell packaged all look really good but I really just do not know what any of them are. And it&#39;s not like I&#39;m gonna ask the guy who looks like he doesn&#39;t even want to talk to me about it. I&#39;d love to try some of those foods, but it would be nice to have some clarity on that. <br><br>All in all, I really like their food! I&#39;ll definitely come back.

    	Honestly, when I first got my special (#1) banh mi, I was a little disappointed by the heft (lack thereof) of the sandwich.  It seem shorter than usual.  It turns out unlike many other things in life, size doesn&#39;t matter.  After the first bite, I can taste the variety and freshness of the meat along with the perfectly place jalapeno/cilantro combination in the middle of the vietnamese cold cuts in a pate and butter smeared fresh crispy pieces of heaven.  The experience was almost orgasmic!!!<br><br>Don&#39;t think for a minute I do not know about banh mi.  I lived in many places in my life time (among other, Eden Center at seven corner in Northern VA) and I have been eating banh mi for almost 30 years.  What makes these so great at Cantina isn&#39;t just one thing, it&#39;s all these seemingly simple ingredient blends harmoniously together.<br><br>As cherry on top, they also have other freshly made vietnamese item like Gio Bi, Bánh Giò, and those fried sesame covered dough ball with mung bean inside.  I had the Bánh Giò and the dough ball thingy, and they are both wonderful.<br><br>Thank you Catina for making me complete.

    	My neighbors recommended this place- I tried coming once and it was closed, so I forgot about it. <br><br>I randomly thought about it today and decided to try again.<br><br>I AM SO GLAD I DID!<br><br>Holy shit.<br><br>I am not too familiar with Vietnamese food and there was a language barrier, so really I had no idea what to expect. Everything including the menu is in Vietnamese, but I don&#39;t scare easily, and really I&#39;ll try anything at least once, so I ordered the chicken sandwich. Service was super quick and 5 minutes later I was handed a warm toasty roll full of the most delicious cilantro, carrots, cucumber, jalapeño and salted chicken I&#39;ve ever had in my life.<br><br>I am sure the bread is home made by the quality of it. <br>They&#39;re only $ 3.95 - honestly, they would be $10 each and I would still come.<br><br>One of the best foodie experiences is when you genuinely don&#39;t know what to expect and you&#39;re mind blown. <br><br>This is my new favorite place in the world in all the galaxies and beyond.

	Alright, so I haven&#39;t been back here since my first and only visit over a year ago. (See previous review.) Today I stopped by to give it another chance (and also I just really, really wanted a banh mi). To my pleasant surprise, the owners either got it together or my last visit was really a fluke. <br><br>While the man at the register was still by no means friendly, he at least acknowledged me right away and took my order as soon as I walked up to the counter. My order took no longer than 10 minutes to come out - MUCH faster than my last visit. <br><br>Banh mi: highly highly recommended the grilled chicken banh mi (#10 I think). Deliciously seasoned, though just a tad salty. I also tried the pork belly banh mi, usually my fave, but the cuts of meat they used were really fatty (even for pork belly) and seasoned oddly. The veges and other accoutrements are the same for each banh mi as far as I can tell. The bread is still perfectly toasted on the outside and soft on the inside, I think they scoop a little bread out too when making sandwiches because the bread to fillings ratio was perfect.<br><br>Drinks: on recommendation of fellow Yelpers, I decided I&#39;d try one of their smoothies/boba drinks. The coconut drink is fantastic, and I&#39;m not usuuuually a fan of coconut. Not too sweet, as many coconut based drinks tend to be, but just right. The tapioca/boba is kinda a let-down though. It&#39;s a little tough and rubbery, not like how boba should be. I think it was just boba that&#39;d been sitting out for too long. I would get a drink without it next time.<br><br>Overall, a much improved experience. I entered with great trepidation and thankfully left happy. I&#39;ll have to stop by again in the coming weeks, but hopefully nothing happens that warrants another review update!

    	Since I&#39;m from Washington, DC and now currently residing in Richmond, it&#39;s difficult for me to find true authentic Vietnamese food/banh mi in the area. Although I must say Catina has the best banh mi I&#39;ve tried so far in Richmond. I come in at least once a week for lunch and am always satisfied with the sub. However, the service seems to be lacking... there is no proper hospitality etiquette- which is a shame since their food is very delicious that you always come back for more. The man and sometimes the lady who works behind the cash register never greets or even smiles. Friendly service would be nice, don&#39;t ya think? Anyways, banh mi get&#39;s my two thumbs up and service gets a thumbs down for me.

    	Bahn Mi.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I need to say more but I will.<br><br>Bahn Mi!<br><br>If you have not eaten these amazing Vietnamese sandwiches, you are missing a true pleasure in life.   I read a little on the Internet (so it must be true!) and learned that bahn mi is actually just the light and crispy baguette on which these sandwiches are made; it&#39;s the rest of the name that makes the magic.  My favorite from Catina so far is the #11 bahn mi heo nuong, which is made with thinly sliced Vietnamese grilled pork.  I&#39;ve also had the #10 bahn mi ga nuong (grilled chicken) and #1 bahn mi thit nguoi (cold cuts).  All were delicious! <br><br>I&#39;m not sure I want to tell you all the typical ingredients, just so you&#39;ll try them &#34;as is&#34; and judge for yourself.  There&#39;s nothing on any of these that will hurt you (just meats, vegetables, and condiments), but some of you might not think of these flavors on a traditional American sandwich.  It&#39;s the bahn mi ingredients that make them so good, in my opinion.  For you Subway fans out there, this is nothing like Subway where you pick and choose the ingredients as they build it before your eyes.  To get the best sandwich I&#39;d recommend you simply step up, request the sandwich by number, pay your $3.50, and patiently wait a few minutes for your your paper-wrapped, rubber band-sealed grinder of goodness.  Your courageousness will pay off!

    	This is a small little Vietnamese bakery in the center of a small shopping center. They&#39;ve got a large selection of different banh mi combination sandwiches, Boba Teas, and other baked goodies. I tend to stop here when i&#39;m in Richmond. My mother frequents here. <br><br>Their Banh mi sandwiches are made to order so they taste &#34;fresh&#34;. I&#39;m always requesting extra jalepenos and the lady  behind the counter (which i think is the owner) always piles it on for me. Don&#39;t think she&#39;s upset when you see her, she doesn&#39;t smile much.  I also LOVE their meat buns. White breading on the outside and its filled with meat and either a quail egg or half an egg in the inside. We call it  Nom Pao in Khmer. Filipinos call them,  Sho Pao&#39;s.  Gotta try it. <br><br> Their boba teas are also delicious. Very affordable here. Bring cash with you! Enjoy!

    	The banh mi here is good enough to satisfy your cravings, and quite possibly one of the only places to get the goods in RVA.<br><br>I usually stopped by here not for the Vietnamese sandwiches, but mainly for the boba tea drinks. Mango is the way to go. I fairly remember it having an unpowdery taste, so I&#39;m pretty sure they use real fruits! <br><br>Bring cash, because there either is a minimum or it&#39;s all cash only.

    	Holy banh mi.<br><br>I&#39;ve been having the most wicked cravings, so I&#39;m deeply happy that I found Catina. For $3.75, you get terrible service, but you get the banh mi that you know and miss.<br><br>For anyone who doesn&#39;t know, a banh mi is a magical sandwich made from a freshly toasted baguette, some mystery meat, picked vegetables, jalapeños, and a buttery mayonnaise spread. I grew up eating pork belly banh mi&#39;s from the grocery store down the street, where they cost $1.50 a pop. <br><br>Catina&#39;s banh mi&#39;s are pretty decent. I believe they are buy 5, get 1 free, which is my dream come true.<br><br>Bring cash, because they don&#39;t accept card. You&#39;ll probably see me there.

    	I love how cheap it is for me to buy banh mi and an avocado boba. I can&#39;t find any other place in RVA that sells boba made with fresh fruit. Its much easier to find at Eden Center in NoVa. The other baked items taste good too but its pricey so don&#39;t really come here for that. Come here for the Banh mi and the boba.

    	Bubble Tea = 5 Stars. After reading some of the other reviews I got the Coconut Boba and it was reeeally good. the consistency was thick without being icy, and the coconut tasted very fresh and nothing like those powder ingredients. Definitely the best boba I&#39;ve had in Richmond.<br><br>Banh Mi = 3 Stars. I&#39;ve been spoiled by delicious and cheap banh mi&#39;s from Northern Virginia and while it wasn&#39;t bad, it was one of the.. more subpar ones. I got the #11 (grilled pork) and #10 (chicken). To me, one of the most important part of banh mi is the crispy baguette. Their bread was tasty, but it was not crispy at ALL. It was more like a bibber hotdog bun. Grilled pork was good but was drenched in sauce and verrrry salty.<br><br>Service = 2 Stars. The old man looked angry the whole time and was not welcoming at all. He literally ignored me for like 5 minutes even though there was noone else in line! The service makes me not want to come back here even though their Boba was on pointtttt.<br><br>**Cash only**

    	Okay so I got the mango bubble tea because I have been craving it and drove all over town try to find it! The tea tastes fine, but the place is absolutely filthy. If you can get past the grime and bugs and the fact that it is cash only, great. But the place made me a little squeamish drinking my tea.

    	Maybe I&#39;m giving this place too many stars, but this is the only place in Richmond I&#39;ve found that does legit Asian smoothies and boba. There&#39;s real fruit and it&#39;s not overly sweet. I haven&#39;t seen litchi anywhere else and Catina&#39;s is sooooo good! The banh mi isn&#39;t bad but I&#39;ve had better. <br>The reasons this place may not deserve all 4 stars is because they are randomly closed with no signage to say when they&#39;ll be back and sometimes the boba is hard and sticks together =|

    	REVIEW UPDATE: They have raised their Bahn Mi prices for the 2nd time in a year. They are now $4.50 (up from $3.75). That&#39;s enough to make me not go as much as I used to. <br><br>...End of Updated Review...<br><br>Very good Bahn Mi for RVA. Not only do they have sandwiches, but they also have bubble tea, some misc. Vietnamese deserts, bake goods, and sides. <br><br>For $3.50 it&#39;s hard to beat this Bahn Mi. Bread is freshly baked, the toppings are fresh and crispy, and the sandwich size is bigger than expected for the price.<br><br>Great place... but let&#39;s not tell too many people about it...

Viktor was able to help me learn and understand the new tea starter kits. He was very nice, knowledgeable, and easy to speak too. I have been back a couple more times since then, still love it. He let me smell the different tea aromas and told me in detail what they were all like, the ingredients, and how they help you in different ways. The store is always nice and neat as well. <br><br>Thanks Teavana, I will definitely be backs for more <br><br>-Victoria

I could see it being great for a morning drink. I was excited to go in with my cousin who had not yet been into Lateefah. She enjoyed learning all about loose leaf tea.

From English Breakfast to Pu-erh there&#39;s everything you can think of. <br><br>Price point: a little high, but they charge per 2oz so definitely worth it.

It is a bit of a drive from Powhatan, but SO worth it! Plus don&#39;t get to exited about the rock sugar - as someone else said its almost worse for you.

	Time for an update! <br><br>They now have free wifi! Yay. That, and it seems like their offerings are getting better and better each day. When I came last week, it was still during Lent and I gave up sweets. So, sadly, I couldn&#39;t try a macaron. I still maintain that their patio is one of the best kept secrets in Richmond. I do wish that there was a way to access it without having to go outside and walk around, but that&#39;s just a minor detail. This is the best little neighborhood coffee/dessert/lunch spot and I&#39;m jealous of everyone who is able to walk here!

    	Came here on a Friday afternoon right after visiting The Poe Museum. This coffee shop is located one block up on the corner.<br><br>Seating is pretty limited here but people are constantly coming and going so the tables open up pretty quickly. You bus the tables yourself and there&#39;s a cart with sugars, creamers, and a tray for dirty dishes. <br><br>I ordered the cappuccino. It was delicious. The coffee was flavorful without needing sugar. They also have a pastry case full of goodies and macaroons the size of HUGE cookies. They&#39;re around $3 a macaroon. Unfortunately, I did not try any out on this trip, the flavors just didn&#39;t appeal to me. <br><br>The place also has complementary wifi but I could not get it to work for my ipad. They only list the password by the register and not the name of the actual wifi.

    	Cute interior, simple packaging. They sell many pastries, croissants, sandwiches, cookies, cakes, macarons and they do serve coffee too! I came here for their macarons.<br><br>Macarons are $3.25 each, $18 for a box of 6, and $35 for 12. The macarons are large and as big as the size of my palm! I prefer the smaller ones, but I guess they want to be a little distinctive from other bakery. The shells are crisp, some were unfortunately very crumbly. The inside fillings flavors was wonderful and had the right amount of sweetness and some are decorated.<br><br>Whisk offer many seasonal and limited edition flavors and are gluten free. They always change up their macaron flavors, so it&#39;s not guaranteed what assortment flavor you&#39;ll find. I would be back to try other pastries.

    	THE CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT BABKA!<br><br>In four words, it&#39;s pretty much why you need to stop in and get a whiff of buttery, baked, golden brown and deliciousness and a peek at the other products Whisk has in store for your sweet (or savory) tooth! I stopped in here with Kristine M. on a visit to nearby downtown Richmond after seeing pictures and reviews of their assortment of macarons and their Bacon Cheddar Bread Pudding. <br><br>On our first visit we bought an assortment of their pastries to try. Kouign Amann (pronounced queen ah-mahn) which is a sweet, buttery, puff pastry; Coconut Lime Macaron, Strawberry Lemonade Macaron, Bacon Cheddar Bread Pudding, and of course the Chocolate Hazelnut Babka. If you look at my pictures, all of the portions are a good size, especially the macarons which are bigger than the standard fare at most bakeries. The subtle crunch from the exterior of the cookies balanced by that signature chew combined with the creamy and flavorful filling inside made for an eye opening to eye closing macaron experience on this day. The Bacon Cheddar Bread Pudding we shared and was very flavorful. The only suggestion I could make for it to be better would be to have it more custard like as it was more dry even after being warmed up. As for...<br><br>THE CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT BABKA! Man what a versatile piece of pastry magic this thing is and it&#39;s pretty dense too! The loaf is topped with a crumb topping and large chocolate chips and the interior is filled with a swirl of chocolate hazelnut awesomeness and REAL hazelnuts to amplify the bread eating experience to the nth degree! I&#39;ve eaten slices of it toasted, plain, but my favorite has to be prepared French Toast style. If you want an eyes rolling in the back of your head experience just google a simple french toast recipe and substitute this for your bread, cut up a few strawberries and get your Emeril on by BAMMING it all over with some powdered sugar. #gamechanger <br><br>When you drive by E Main St. you pretty much can&#39;t miss the big mural outside with the logo. It&#39;s pretty much a bakery bat signal that&#39;s how big it is! Stop in and grab yourself some well prepared, delicious goodies for yourself or make some friends happy too!

    	Whisk is just plain old fun. I didn&#39;t realize I hadn&#39;t reviewed it but I&#39;ve been going here since it opened for yummy coffee and pastries. Oh, and the flowers they always have on the table are a plus for Instagram photos and general happy vibes when eating here. We ordered a  pistachio cake for a friend&#39;s birthday and it was delicious. I&#39;ve had the macaroons which are rather large, the everything bagel croissant, the strawberry Nutella croissant, the Whisker cookie, and more. They have a happy hour which I would try if I lived closer...but for now, I just go for coffee and I&#39;m halfway to a free pastry via my punch card. Go here if you&#39;re in the mood for a little afternoon pick me up and you won&#39;t be disappointed.

    	Cute bakery!! I finally had the chance to stop by this place! When you walk in, you are greeted by the counter that&#39;s full of croissants and beautiful pastries!<br><br>I ordered the chocolate mint matcha macaroon and a savory ham/Swiss croissant that I warmed up. The croissant was super flaky and very tasty! I highly recommend getting any type of croissant if you come here. It&#39;s super messy but totally worth it. My chocolate mint matcha macaroon was also amazing! I&#39;m obsessed with anything green tea and chocolate, so this was a match made in heaven! It was also really big, almost the size of my small hand! I definitely for sure want to come back and try other croissants and pastries!

    	I had my eye on Whisk for a while now as RVA has many cute little coffee shops and finally decided to stop in and try them out! I loved how inviting the atmosphere was. The staff was welcoming and I loved how bright inside it was not to mention SUPER CUTE decor. <br><br>The glass rainbow colored window inside provides nice character. I really enjoyed how a lot of the customers inside had their laptops and felt they could do their work or school assignments. A friend and I decided to grab coffee and macaroons while adventuring in RVA. <br><br>My friend had a raspberry macaroon while I had ordered an almond sea salt macaroon in addition to, a pistachio macaroon to go. (All of which were great choices, almond sea salt was the best though). The macaroons were pretty big for only $3.25. The bakery items looked fresh and offered a wide variety to choose from. The coffee was on the strong side even with flavor added to it despite that I&#39;d say I really enjoyed my experience and will probably come back again!

    	I love this coffee shop! It&#39;s a great place for a quick cup of coffee or a bite for lunch. I love how they have seasonal treats, their macaroons and menu changes with the seasons and holidays. It&#39;s always fun to see what&#39;s next! <br><br>Everyone here is so friendly, the only thing left for me to try is their cake, so I keep hoping I pop in at the right time!

    	This is a great little neighborhood cafe just a short walk from our apartment in Shockoe Bottom. They have a great selection of local coffee as well as their own pastries and signature sandwiches like The Richmonder (pictured). <br><br>If you decide to dine or drink in, they even offer free refills on coffee and tea beverages, which is definitely an added bonus.<br><br>They also offer a happy hour but only have wine. Sorry beer drinkers, it&#39;s no &#34;hoppy hour&#34; for you.<br><br>It would be cool if they had more vegan options as the only bread we could have was the baguette, which is baked fresh daily and pairs well with pineapple jam.

	*updated review*<br><br>I don&#39;t know when Whisk originally opened, or if I wrote my last review based on its opening days, or if they have changed something, but I have come to love this place! <br><br>I remember thinking back then that their coffee was very watered down, but I have consistently gotten some really good coffee lately. I also recommend any and all of their croissants! Plain, chocolate almond, sun-dried tomato with goat cheese, etc, are all flaky and delicious. They also have a bunch of new macaroon flavors every day. They have that crunchy texture on the outside while creamy on the inside, with their flavors subtlely infused. I don&#39;t know what they changed, but whatever it is, it&#39;s workin!<br><br>Also a good place to sit and get work done!

    	I like whisk a lot. This is a super cute place to catch up with a friend or study/ work or to just stop in and pick up a few things to take home. Their campfire cookie and whisker (a better/ bigger oreo) are probably my favorite things I have had here. I have tried a few of the macarons and matcha is definitely my favorite flavor. They are bigger and flatter than most macarons, and can sometimes be a little oily. I had heard a lot of good things about their bacon and cheddar croissant bread pudding so I had to give it a try. I would say it was good but not great. I thought the flavor could have been a stronger and I probably won&#39;t get it again. Overall I think they make good products that I will continue to buy.

    	This Kickstarter-funded brick &amp; mortar smelled great! Lots of street parking in the area. The seating inside goes quick, but the back patio around the corner is adorable. Be sure to snag a frequent flyer card, and note their list of flavor shots by the register manned by friendly staff members.<br><br>Everything was cute and generously portioned, but so far execution has been just okay. Latte was fine. Chocolate almond croissant was dense and not especially flaky. The American-sized macarons have great flavor, though the texture&#39;s not very airy; also had similar reaction to the fist-sized choux. Gougères were a little flatter than average, and less flavorful than the other items we tried. The ice cream sandwich was tasty but just a touch richer than I&#39;d like for that portioning, easily shared with multiple people. I&#39;ll come back to try their cheddar bacon croissant bread pudding, kouign amann, and basil lemonade.

    	Attention Instagram lovers, I think I just found our dream cafe !! It has everything us foodies look for in a photo-worthy place: good lighting, exposed brick, and pretty pastries all tucked away in a little corner coffee shop. <br><br>I came here in hopes to try one of their super cute French macaron ice cream sandwiches I&#39;ve been drooling over on Instagram, there was even a sign outside saying they had them, but to my disappointment, I was served an oatmeal cookie ice cream sandwich instead. I wish they would have told me that it was an oatmeal cookie when I was ordering and before I paid .. They even looked at me like I was crazy when I said, &#34;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I wanted the French macaron ice cream sandwich.&#34; To which they replied, &#34;Yes. That&#39;s it ... just a cookie because we&#39;re out of the French Macarons.&#34; Yikes. <br><br>It was pretty okay, though. Today&#39;s flavor was &#34;Apple Ginger.&#34; My bf and I thought it tasted a lot like apple pie! We also tried their HUGE mango French macaron and it was yummy too! Not grainy, smooth texture, and not too sugary. I would definitely like to come back the next time I&#39;m ever in Richmond to try their other menu items!

They also have plenty of vegan options which is sincerely important to us! I am obsessed with their iced chai latte and macaroons! The rose macaroon is the. Eat I have ever had and they are very generous portions! Very cozy, light space to catch up on work or catch up with a friend.

    	Only in America could they literally blow up the size of the french macaroon. It&#39;s hit or miss--some days it&#39;ll be too crumbly and some days it&#39;ll be hard from the inside out.<br><br>The people who work there couldn&#39;t care less about helping you.

    	Whisk was a cute little coffee shop we found trying to find another coffee shop in downtown Richmond. It is located off 21st and Main. It is a cute little cafe. This is a great place to come if I lived here and wanted a place to study. <br><br>I got a iced coffee and the seasonal savory croissant. The iced coffee was good, but not the best iced coffee I&#39;ve had. But on a hot August day it was just what I needed. The croissant was delicious. It was a regular croissant with pimento cheese. The croissant was flaky and buttery. I don&#39;t know why but the pimento cheese paired really well with the croissant. It paired perfectly with my cold brew.<br><br>There are not a ton of places to sit. I&#39;m not sure what this place is like when college is back in session, but I can see this place filling up very fast. If you are looking for a cute cafe, good coffee and delicious pastries Whisk is a good option.

    	I&#39;ve had Whisk on my bookmark for quite sometime now and finally, I tried it. Immediately upon walking in you are gracefully greeted with a mouth-watering baked cookie smell. No, seriously! <br><br>Clearly I was very excited. I ordered their orange macaron which by the way, HUGE! Almost twice the size of a traditional macaron! I loved the way it tasted and I would totally order it again (duh, worth every penny!) My boyfriend got their chocolate croissant but he didn&#39;t really like it. We got drinks as well but both had such strong grainy flavors. It had so many coffee grains at the bottom and as crazy reference as this may sound, it reminded me of Harry Potter&#39;s grim teacup during his divination lesson (of course this won&#39;t make any sense if you aren&#39;t a potter fan :[ ). <br><br>Anyways, cute cafe with very minimal decor. A nice place to stop by to grab something quick or even to just enjoy a coffee break. I mean, let&#39;s face it everyone loves shockoe bottom!

    	I&#39;ve been so excited to try Whisk after seeing all the aesthetically pleasing photos that friends have posted on Instagram. My expectations were very high, and this cute little coffee shop did not disappoint!<br><br>As far as I know, Whisk is the only place in RVA to get macarons. Not only are their macarons huge, but they&#39;re well-executed too - crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside and not stale or crumbly or overbaked.<br><br>I tried a bit of my sister&#39;s chocolate croissant and it was buttery and delicious; I could really tell it was homemade. After eating it I think I have a newfound appreciation for croissants.<br><br>I was also very pleased with my drink order - a mocha latte with almond milk. I especially loved how the barista gave us each a cute and unique little design with the chocolate syrup!<br><br>The interior is bright and very charming. I loved the stained glass windows and how it would cast soft colors onto the tables when the afternoon sunlight was pouring through. <br><br>From the coffee, to the pastries, to the interior, Whisk has everything that I could ever want in a cafe! Will be returning as soon as possible.

    	Picture, if you will, my humble self, jetlagged and zombied, wandering in and staring vacantly at the pastry case [dangerous, seriously]. Gently nudged into ordering, I nibble canelés [yeeeeees] and sip the first proper cup of tea I&#39;ve had in weeks [pro tip, Germany is not known for its tea] while waiting for my breakfast biscuit [small upcharge for the bikkie, well worth it though I hear good things about the english muffins too] with bacon [also extra, also excellent, if one likes piggy bits]. I mostly zone out through several more customers ordering, then blearily question if I&#39;ve paid or not, which I have not, handily allowing me to order muffins [they do gluten free and vegan, both of which are incredibly good, especially if toasted] and a slice of coconut custard pie to go [even tastier], all of which somehow comes to about half what my brain expected, numerically.<br><br>A+, cannot recommend highly enough.

OMG, they were heavenly. We tried blueberry muffins, raspberry and almond muffins, ham and cheese paquets, spinach/artichoke/feta paquets, and some other savory delicious paquet. While there, I was told about their breakfast sandwiches made with homemade english muffins or biscuits...Oh I will be back for one of those!<br><br>While I didn&#39;t try anything during this visit, they have a full coffee and beverage menu.

If you&#39;ve never been I can let you know everything is great here, but to call out some favorites:<br><br>-Buttermilk Pie <br>-Paquets (any flavor, really)<br>-Mexican chocolate pie<br>-Peanut butter pie<br><br>This location is a bit bigger and has more seating than the Church Hill mothership, which is great. It&#39;s cozy and bright in there and they make a good use of the space. We&#39;ve been a few times now and they are still ironing out some opening-week wrinkles, but everything has been so delicious and the staff has been great. <br><br>Don&#39;t forget to grab a treat for your pooch, mine loves them.

    	Having gone to Laura Lee restaurant, (2 doors down) the night before, we noticed this place as we had parked right in front of it. We agreed to return the next AM for breakfast since we had to return to the Woodland Heights area the next morning.<br>So glad we did. Mad props go to owners like these who &#34;keep it real.&#34; I was also impressed that the amazing bread that the aforementioned new area restaurant served the night prior with our charcuterie plate, comes from this place. Just a great baguette.<br>They have the most amazing, made here, English muffins you will ever shove in your soup cooler. My wife had her breakfast sandwich on a GF version which was also amazing, and it made a compelling case for me to go GF as well. I ordered mine on a regular English muffin with egg, cheddar, bacon AND ham, (to better honor the amazing animal that is the swine), with a cup of coffee. <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FDeliciousness.com&amp;s=f7c854f23d308e38bcde3c07e60462d23a9094702f0e9107f63e3ea40da3928e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deliciousness.com</a>! I chased it with a wonderful GF canela that was sweet, and creamy on the inside. <br>They have everything available here from pies, to cakes, to fancy looking pastries, cookies, and other delights that seem inspired as well as delicious. <br>Thank you team WPA!

    	After reading several reviews for WPA Southside, I decided to drop by after leaving downtown Richmond late yesterday morning. Though I&#39;d eaten breakfast earlier in the morning, I wanted to see what pies, muffins, and / or pastries I could take home.<br><br>WPA Southside is a quaint shop at Semmes and Forest Hill with a pleasant décor with a friendly and courteous staff. My server took the time to answer my questions and I truly enjoyed talking with her. After our conversation I decided to order a ham &amp; pesto on small roll and a couple of slices of pecan pie to go. The ham &amp; pesto was very good and I will certainly return to try others such as salami &amp; pesto.<br><br>After our dinner yesterday evening we tried the pecan pie and I must admit it was a little different. WPA&#39;s pecan pie had more than enough pecans and in my humble opinion not enough custard. The taste was good and it did not have an overbearing sweetness. My wife described it as a cross between a cookie and a pie, which described it perfectly. Again, not a bad taste, just different.<br><br>Though my first visit wasn&#39;t that &#39;knock your socks off&#39; experience, I will certainly return to try other items.

    	Happy to have WPA in the neighborhood. The majority of the time I find the baked goods delicious &amp; well made however I have noticed some things need tweaking.  Sometimes there is a lack of consistency with their baked goods (probably depends on who&#39;s baking).  What i go for is the egg &amp; cheese biscuit and 2/5 times the biscuit is a little hard or overdone.  The size also differs drastically.  I&#39;ve gotten a couple desserts that were surprisingly bad like a cinnamon roll that was sooo undercooked it was doughy .  And an oddly textured cherry pistachio brownie.(like a sponge cake?) <br><br>Another place they could improve is with drink offerings.  They dont do iced tea nor bottled/boxed water.  I usually take my goods to go &amp; this would benefit me (perhaps others) greatly. <br><br>In my opinion what they do best is pies.  I&#39;ve yet to have a bad piece of pie here. They also have something for everyone which i appreciate - whether it&#39;s vegan or gluten free there&#39;s options for you.  They also aren&#39;t afraid to experiment with new desserts.  So props to WPA. A few improvements and this great place could be even better.

The people who work there are very pleasant and provided useful input/opinion when you&#39;re trying to decide which of the pies to try.<br><br>The inside is very cozy with furniture all made out of wood and just the right amount of sunlight.

    	10.9.16  Went back to WPA today.  Best visit yet.  They finally had the almond buttermilk pie-- so I got two pieces!!!  (I&#39;d been back an additional 2 times since my last review and they still didn&#39;t have it :(    My son got the chocolate chess pie (delicious-- reminiscent of my childhood church days in the rural south), I got my husband the raspberry cheesecake--also delicious-- dense and you could taste a bit of lemon or acidity in it.  My son and I also split a muffin on the walk back home--it was one of the $1 items by the cash register.  Surprisingly, this visit was only $17!  The only down side?  No bags to put the boxes in to carry home-- although they looked for us! :)  Luckily, I had a big purse and it&#39;s only a 10 block walk!<br><br>8.15.16  I am glad they are here on Southside!  I welcome any business that amps up our little retail spaces over here on Forest Hill!  I&#39;ve been to the bakery around 5 times and bought twice, due to the fact that they do not consistently carry the same desserts-- which bugs me crazy bad!!!  The first time there I had the buttermilk almond pie and my husband the hummingbird cake.  The buttermilk pie was out of this world amazing-- like &#34;Oh my god-- I&#39;m am getting back in touch with myself and tuning out the kids heavenly, amazing!&#34;.  My husband also enjoyed his.  I&#39;ve been back 4 times and they haven&#39;t had it.  3 of the times, I walked back out.  Today, my fifth time there, they didn&#39;t have it again, but I got the hummingbird cake (which was amazing and better than the first time) and the butterscotch cheesecake which for me was --meh.  My husband and MIL liked it though.  It always irks me too when the servers suggest that I can pre-order an almond buttermilk pie.  It&#39;s like &#34;NO, I don&#39;t want your $30 pie, nor does this 36 year old overweight mom of two need a whole pie. I just want YOU to make the pie and I buy an overpriced $4, once a week&#34;.  <br><br>Did I mention I like the pie?

It comes with your choice of soup,  various canapes, hors devours, tea sandwiches, scones, fresh Devonshire cream, jam, fresh fruit, and desserts; as well as a pot of tea. I always choose the hot cinnamon tea as my pot of comfort. You may even purchase a tin of the tea to enjoy at home. The service is always beyond stellar, and everyone leaves happy.

With that being said it was an overall wonderful experience. The food is good and the tea is hot!

    	I am an avid fan of anything to do with tea. I have been to many tea rooms in my day. I even studied in England for a semester and enjoyed some authentic high teas there. I must say The Blue Willow in Petersburg, VA surpassed them all. The food was incredible and the service impeccable. Kirsti suggested I break with my comfortable old standby tea selections and try something new that she thought I&#39;d enjoy; I&#39;m so glad I did. There were wonderful warm/hot items in their afternoon tea which isn&#39;t easy to come by in most tea rooms. The soup was a sausage soup and was just lovely -- flavorful and filling. They worked hard to please our young daughters (ages 3 and 7) who still rave about their &#34;tea party&#34; at The Blue Willow. Months later I called to order a gift certificate for my godmother&#39;s birthday and they remembered us before I could even remind them. This tea room delivers the epitome of southern charm and hospitality with some of the best food around. I hope to visit again very soon. If you love tea rooms, you have to make this a &#34;must do&#34; on your next trip to Petersburg (or even if just passing through VA). Sid and Kirsti will make you feel like old friends. Don&#39;t miss this GEM of a tea room.<br><br>Oh -- and for that reviewer who said the staff is not knowledgeable about tea and that you don&#39;t leave tea to steep in a teapot -- she&#39;s wrong. Every tea room I&#39;ve been to -- including those in England (and in the homes of my grandmother who came here directly from Ireland, my good Scottish friend born and raised in Scotland and a neighbor from England,) -- all add loose tea leaves to a pot and they NEVER remove them. That&#39;s why they give you those tea strainers for the top of your cup. You add more hot water if you like -- which of course dilutes -- but you never remove the tea leaves. I have never seen anyone remove the tea. So maybe your experience has been different but to insult your hosts who do it the way most of the world does -- is wrong and just plain uncouth.

    	Wow! I hosted a Bridal Shower at Blue Willow Tea Room yesterday afternoon and the event could not have been more stress free or enjoyable.  The ambiance of the place is precious, and the ceiling is to die for! The Room is decorated with antiques and art available for purchase and the tea was served on china.  There are several brands and varieties of tea to chose from, as well as platters to share.  For the bridal shower, we chose the Luncheon Tea to split between two people, an extra pot of tea, and a glass of prosecco.  Everything was presented nicely and very tasty.  The servers were so fun and sweet and it truly made for a hassle free, affordable, and ultimately lovely bridal shower. Can&#39;t not wait to return with my mother and sister for another charming afternoon tea.

    	This place is so adorable, and the perfect spot to unwind when we spend the day walking around the fun antique shops in Petersburg.  We ordered the full afternoon tea, which was lovely and tasty, with our favorite items being the delicious soup and the great scones.  The interior decor is very cute and gives patrons lots to look at.  <br><br>The service experience was odd, though.  I asked for black tea and was told they don&#39;t have that.  I pointed out the menu listing english breakfast, and the server told me that is not black tea.  I have lived in both England and Scotland.  My wife and I deeply love and return to the UK as often as possible, which is one of the reasons this little place in Petersburg caught our eye.  Our cabinet at home is filled with British tea.  I assure you...english breakfast is black tea.  So that was weird.  <br><br>Once the tea came, we were advised to leave it to steep indefinitely.  I explained that we preferred to remove the tea from the water after steeping time so it wouldn&#39;t get bitter, and the server told me it wouldn&#39;t get bitter and that she has left her tea to steep for two hours with no bitterness.  That&#39;s not how tea is steeped.  It was bizarre to us that a tea room attendant was so untrained in the basics of making and serving tea correctly.  We had this advice three times, from two different servers, throughout the experience.  I have no idea why they were so adamant about it.  Milk was not served (also weird) but we didn&#39;t ask for it because we didn&#39;t want another round of &#34;advice&#34;.  <br><br>Although the service was so awkward, the food was filling and tasty, the environment is cozy, and the menu offers lots of options.  All up, I would return to Blue Willow because it seems to be a great business that simply needs to train a few empoyees on tea service and customer service.  That&#39;s an easy fix, and I hope they make it, because it&#39;s great to have such a cute spot in Petersburg.

    	Took my wife and in-laws here for a late Mother&#39;s Day outing.  Very pleasant &#34;antiquey&#34; decor.  The small dining room is in fact attached to a antique shop which sits along a picturesque cobblestone street.  The table ordered two &#34;full afternoon teas&#34; which were each served with a pot of our choice of tea and a delicious complement of small sandwiches, canapés, and soup.  Everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  It is only because everything else was so very well done that I noticed they used single-serve creamers instead of a more elegant solution.  Again, super nitpicky I grant you, but this IS a review after all.  All that said, I will certainly dine here again.

    	Have been twice on different occasions and love it more each time!! The full afternoon tea is made up of such yumminess, you have to go and taste for yourself!  Although the surroundings are beautiful this little tea haven isn&#39;t stuffy or pretentious.  It is a neighborhood spot where you are welcomed like a regular even if it is your first time visiting!  Reservations are recommended but if you are having a hankering to give this place a try give them a call, you may just get a table right away.... Enjoy!

    	(First, we showed up today when we had been told over the phone they were booked. There was a table for my mom and me after all...yay! )<br>I was really excited to be taking my mom there since I had heard such great things! The entire experience did not disappoint. We had a lovely waitress...table on the left around 12:30- you know who you are!- the carrot relish ROCKS in the most unsuspecting kind of way. Devonshire-yum!!<br>The only thing I would change is the silverware. I think fancy unmatched silverware would have been cool. I guess because of the shop next door, I expected it. <br>2 huge thumbs up, go now!!

    	First off, the family that runs this place is amazingly sincere. They are so kind, and even when I ordered something that they had never heard of, they were more than willing to try it out.<br><br>Now to the food: I got a cocogato (also known as a chocogato). It was, by far, my favorite hot chocolate drink EVER! I say this as someone who has lived through Canadian winters--and trust me, I&#39;ve had some awesome hot chocolates :) this one was so rich though, and the addition of a scoop of ice cream was simply heaven. My fiance ordered their fruitier selections--lemon with blueberry and mango--and absolutely loved it. He said next time he wants to try adding in some white chocolate chips to make it taste like a lemoncello. <br><br>Overall, I&#39;m very happy to live so close to an amazing gelato place. The prices are decent and it&#39;s family run; and there&#39;s picnic benches outside that allow our dog to join us on the warmer days. This place is definitely worth a try!! :D

    	Met with some friends at 21Hundred for coffee and baby shower planning! I got there first and the owner (I didn&#39;t catch his name) and his daughter Maddie were incredibly friendly. I asked about the decor and got some interesting insight, tried a couple of the gelato flavors (the toasted coconut/almond/fudge flavor was delightful!), and learned about the different types of beverages they serve. Maddie made me a cafe con leche and it was SO GOOD. We were louder than I thought we&#39;d be (I&#39;m SO sorry!), but they were so incredibly welcoming. The shop is warm, friendly, and inviting. I will be coming back to try more drinks, gelato, and pastries!

    	What a wonderful coffee shop! So I thought it was just a coffee shop but they also serve gelato. My mom had the German chocolate cake gelato (which I also tried) and we both thought it was delicious! What we really liked about it is that it&#39;s not overly sweet. I had a latte with vanilla bean flavoring. I couldn&#39;t really pick up on the vanilla flavor at all, but it was still good. It had a strong coffee taste from the espresso which I found really nice. The decor was also really lovely. They do this rewards program (a punch card) for their gelato AND their coffee so if you go there enough you can get one for free! Staff was also very friendly. I&#39;d highly recommend. I&#39;ll be returning!

    	So glad to see a new coffee and gelato place open within walking distance of our home. Every morning my husband and I walk our dogs and we decided to give them a try. The coffee is strong but really good. They offer dark, medium and decaf. I had an iced americano and thought it was good. Their technique in making it could use some improvement to keep the americano from getting bitter. It should be a little room temp water at the bottom, brew espresso into the cup, then add ice. Adding ice and brewing espresso over ice shocks it and makes it bitter. <br><br>We will give them a try soon for their gelato be will definitely be back to try the other coffee drinks. I think they use Blanchard&#39;s, which is a terrific local brand.

The place is so cool and chill.  Club chairs, burlap decor, coffee bean bags, chalk boards... The family who owns this shop was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  The gelato was so refreshing and tasty.  Party in my mouth!  Collectively we had the peanut butter cup, triple chocolate and mint chip! We sampled the pumpkin spice creme brûlée which I will get next time!! I have a feeling this will be a regular pit stop after work.  Uh, my hips are starting to worry.

    	This place has the best biscuits I have ever eaten!  We went here on a Saturday morning, bright and early.  There was only a little bit of a line out these door, but we were quickly brought in by a lovely woman out in the front, helping to organize the flow--so helpful!  The people working behind the counter were super helpful and patient as we picked out what we wanted and really lovely.  I got the biscuit with jam and the bf got the biscuit of the day--which was some egg and cheese combo, but incredible!  Will repeat this as much as possible.  You will love!!  <br><br>Also, did not even get to take a picture of my food because it was eaten so quickly :).

    	I kept passing this spot and since biscuits are the most important meal of the day I decided I try them out. Walked in and I wasn&#39;t greeted which isn&#39;t the end of the world but usually cozy spots like this keep that southern hospitality flowing in copious amounts. It wasn&#39;t busy as there were only three people in the establishment. <br><br>I ordered the chicken salad biscuit sandwich since the other 2 I wanted to try were sold out. The young woman at the register was kind enough but I kept getting disconcerting stares from 2 gentlemen who kept emerging from the back of the house. Weird. <br><br>Once I received my biscuit I sat to eat and excitedly raised it to take a bite! It was so dry I had to buy a beverage almost immediately. Thankfully the barista there was expeditious. <br><br>The chicken salad wasn&#39;t as flavorful as it could or should have been though it was packed with the trappings of a rustic recipe. A robust cheese would have improved the taste for sure. I powered through the rest of the biscuit, finished my beverage and took my leave. <br><br>I was incredibly disappointed though I had been waiting to try this place for a while. I would highly suggest one of the other biscuit spots in the city. I may give them one more college try in the future but I&#39;ll need time to heal this wound.

    	I&#39;m a biscuit fiend, so this place has been on my radar for quite a while. We arrived at prime rush time, 11 AM on a Saturday and we didn&#39;t have to wait too long, about 15 minutes. The crowd control guy was pretty nice and told us the specials and recommendations. I got the biscuit and jam and my boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich of the day. They ran out of the raspberry jam which I was a bit bummed about but they had cinnamon peach jam which was pretty good. <br>The space is very tiny but we were lucky to snag a table. Everyone inside was really pleasant. <br>I can&#39;t help but compare to the Fancy Biscuit nearby. I think if I had to compare the two. Early Bird&#39;s biscuit itself is pretty perfect, salty and buttery, I savored each bite. My boyfriend preferred the fried chicken sandwich at Fancy Biscuit. We also ordered a cappuccino which was delicious, strong, and creamy. I&#39;d definitely visit again~

    	Yum! <br><br>This place was recommended to us by our waitress at The Daily when we told her we were in town for girl&#39;s weekend. <br><br>We arrived about an hour before closing - 11am - on a Saturday and saw about 5 people in line ahead of us.  Not too bad.  The line moved fairly quickly - we waited perhaps 10 minutes before we were next inside - the gal doing crowd control at the entrance was adorable and friendly - she answered questions and talked about the menu for the day while we waited.  <br><br>Once inside - the Biscuit Company is charming and cute as can be.  The staff were very friendly and efficient.  They were only sold out of the heart-shaped special Valentine&#39;s Day pop tarts (BUMMER) but had everything else.  Since we knew we wouldn&#39;t be here again any time soon - my friend and I ordered a ton of stuff so we could taste everything. <br><br>She ordered the biscuit of the day - which was a cheese and chive omelette biscuit and she got the Virginia ham biscuit.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy and the other sweet biscuit of the day which had a chocolate glaze and cinnamon red hots.  <br><br>The biscuits are DELICIOUS and fluffy and warm and fresh and soft.  The biscuits and gravy was really good - the white sausage gravy was really delicious.  I also loved the ham biscuit - those two were my favorite.  <br><br>There are about 4 tables I think inside - there is also a little bar area where you can stand and eat and two cute little tables with two seats each outside.  <br><br>Great service, friendly staff, good food, adorable location, changing menu, and local.  What more could you want?!  This is exactly the kind of place I like to find when I travel.  If you love biscuits (and who doesn&#39;t?) you need to stop in.

Awesome customer service, simple but at the same time complex food with awesome ingredients and flavor...and I&#39;m sure this will soon be synonymous with Richmond just like Millie&#39;s and Lemaire. I stop by here at least once a month and purchase biscuits for my staff at work, and I try each time to introduce someone new to the fabulous food here, and they all love it.

    	Perfect place to get your biscuit fix. <br><br>Dropped by in the early afternoon to find only 2 people ahead of me in line. <br><br>I ordered the biscuit with House made Pimento cheese and applewood smoked bacon - $5.95. The portion of pimento cheese was generous and satisfied my craving for pure indulgence. I also tried out the (biscuit of the day) Chocolate Peanut Butter biscuit $2.65. It took a lot of self control for me to not buy another biscuit to-go.<br><br>Both biscuits were slightly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. When one dreams of how a biscuit should taste, Early bird delivers.

    	Visited Early Bird Biscuit Company for the second time today. And, for the second time, I was a few minutes late and it had closed. I was plainly disappointed. The owner came to the door and told me he&#39;d get me biscuits. I expected he&#39;d bring me a menu and was very pleased. Instead, he came to the door with a half dozen biscuits and homemade jam! I asked him how much I owed and he said, &#34;No charge. Happy Easter!&#39; Wow! And those biscuits and jam are the best! Looking forward to going back during business hours soon!

    	I heard that lines here can get very long and I fortunately came when they were not busy and was actually able to dine-in. There are just a scant number of tables in this small space and they are definitely more of a to-go place. <br><br>They offer a pretty limited menu and begin their lunch items at 11AM. Everyday, they offer a different unique biscuit (could be savory or sweet) as well as a breakfast sandwich of the day. I tried their biscuits n&#39; crazy which is just their biscuits with sausage gravy as well as their chicken salad biscuit. The biscuit themselves were crispy on the outside while super pillowy and fluffy inside. Their gravy was served on the side and was very peppery which I think could be overwhelming for some but I love black pepper so I enjoyed it. Their chicken salad biscuit was simple, but good--the green apples added a nice crunch to it and the cold salad went nicely with the super hot biscuit.

    	Comforting, buttery biscuits soft on the inside with just enough crust. Served with fillings I sure never thought of - ham biscuit and a biscuit with jelly to be sure, but several other combinations to make a balanced lunch. Four of us walked over from an afternoon at the museums to have lunch. We arrived about 12:30 and they were already sold out of the sweet potato biscuits and the pulled pork but there were other great choices, two of us had the pimento cheese and bacon; one had the BAP Bacon, arugula, and red peppers; and another had the fig and goat cheese biscuit.  REALLY great service, when it got busy a third server came from the back to help; and when we did have one issue with one of the sandwiches that got delayed or missed, they were so sweet and gave our friend some extra biscuits and jelly for the trouble.<br>On a week day for a lateish lunch, no problem getting in and out but remember they close at 2 PM. Look for the most current menu on the stand in front of the counter, it might be edited to let you know what&#39;s already sold out. You go to the counter, place your order with your name, then wait to do a pickup at the end of the counter. There are 3 tables inside that are set for 2 but can take more - there are a couple of classic wooden folding chairs if you need extras. Also inside are a couple of countertop stools and table at the window; and a couple schoolroom type desks if you just want a quick seat while waiting. Outside there are 2 tables with 2 chairs each, seating is limited so be prepared to carry-out. We were ready to take our order and go sit outside the museum on a beautiful day, but tables were open when we got our order so we nabbed one and stayed to get some of the bakery favorites too. Don&#39;t miss the bakery sweets - we split cookies because they are so big, chocolate and caramel for us. Really wanted to try on of the &#34;hand pies&#34; that come both in savory and sweet choices - but that had to wait for another trip.

    	Local Favorite!  Make sure to get their early to beat the morning rush.<br><br>Even on a gloomy rainy day, there was a line when I got there.  My fiance and I decided to wait and fortunately the line was moving quick that day.<br><br>As we always do, we decided to order multiple things off the menu and share.  Sonia got the biscuit and gravy and I got the biscuit with homemade jam.  They do offer a variety of different styles and have a flavor of the day so be sure to check those out as well!<br><br>BISCUIT - this is heaven.  The outside is the perfect about of crisp while the inside is so fluffy and almost a cake sponge like texture.  It was just the right about of butter.<br><br>Gravy - I LOVED the gravy but unfortunately it was just a tad too peppery for Sonia.  The black pepper does make the gravy have a slight kick to it but I&#39;d highly recommended getting it at least once to try it.  I really enjoyed it with the small pieces of sausages.<br><br>Jam - for a safer bet, but nonetheless DELICIOUS bet, get their jam.  Sometimes simple is just better.  This was delicious to eat while drinking our coffee and tea brewed right at the counter.<br><br>Really enjoyed the service, speed of operation, and the ambiance that Early Bird Biscuit Company had to provide.  Will definitely visit again - hopefully soon.

    	I have been wanting to try this place for several months. My wife goes here about once a week and gives it a rave review. So today was the day... I have to say I was very disappointed. I was not disappointed in the service at all their service was impeccable, it was simply the biscuits themselves that I did not like. I tried two different ones. <br><br>OK as a disclaimer I must first say that I am a biscuit junkie, maybe even a biscuit snob. I make biscuits from scratch at home almost every weekend for my family and I&#39;m very particular about the leavening process of biscuit making. A true southern biscuit maker at heart, since the days of working at my grandparents restaurant as a teenager.<br>The first one I had was a ham biscuit. The slab of ham on the biscuit was cut way too thick. Basically you have to destroy the biscuit in order to take a bite of the ham. Also it was supposed to be salt cured ham, but was kind of weak in that area. <br>The second biscuit that I had was the &#34;biscuit of the day&#34;. It was cheddar and old bay flavored. The cheddar was strong enough in it for sure just the biscuit itself is weak. Their biscuits lack any kind of buttery background going on in it and they seem quite dry. <br>I will give them another shot again just because of their customer service alone, which as I said previously was very good. It is a very cute place inside and they seem to be doing a very good business for the locals in the area.

    	Absolutely loved the Early Bird Biscuit Co.  When we pulled up there was a little bit of a line (roughly 20 or so people deep) I took this as a good sign that all the Yelp reviews were right...and they were.  The biscuits here are so tender and flaky, what really sends them over the edge though is the homemade jams!  During our visit we were offered their blackberry peach jam or peach mango.  Both were insanely delicious.  We also shared a biscuit Sammy of the day which was a Canadian bacon, mushroom, egg &amp; swiss cheese biscuit.  It was incredible...in fact as I was eating my half I was regretting that we opted to share!  We&#39;ll definitely be hitting them up again next time we&#39;re in town.

    	I didn&#39;t know I loved biscuits until Early Bird. Now I compare every biscuit I try and none have measured up to Early Bird&#39;s buttermilk. I love the biscuit of the day as a change of pace and creative flavors and the staff are always so friendly and quick.

    	The biscuits &#39;n crazy is heaven! Fluffy, buttery, mouth-watering biscuit with a generous side tub of savory gravy that left an amazing impression that few biscuit places have been able to do, and I&#39;ve tried them all over the South and East Coast. Friendly service, cozy atmosphere, and easy parking. I&#39;d definitely come back next time I&#39;m in Richmond

    	I am not even going to lie. I cried when I ate their biscuits and gravy. Not because it was bad but because it was so amazing! <br>It tasted EXACTLY like my Dad&#39;s recipe and unfortunately he passed away 8 years ago. The gravy is that White Flour base with sausage. It had just enough pepper to be a hint spicy. The Biscuits are light and fluffy and hold up to the substantial gravy. <br>We also had a Ham Biscuit and it was very very good too. True Southern Salted Ham <br><br>If there was any way I could have gotten the recipe for the gravy I would legitimately do it. <br><br>The only downside of the restaurant is that it is a little small like most places in The Fan but if it is a nice day they do have seats available outside as well.

    	So a cafe that prides itself on biscuits...that&#39;s a pretty bold move. The Mrs. tried the ham biscuit, this is a biscuit that she swears by at Hardee&#39;s because of their country ham. I had the cheddar, scallion, egg biscuit add bacon. They are store made right in front of your eyes. This place cranks out biscuits like KFC does chicken. The cafe is small don&#39;t expect to find a seat to enjoy your biscuit, 6 settings in store and two outside.<br>First thing we notice is that the biscuits needed more butter...of course that would be something we notice! My wife also noted that her biscuit was not hot...mine was though.<br>Second thing was the ham display had more ham than you actually get on your biscuit, marketing at it&#39;s finest.<br>Thirdly the signs read &#34;flaky&#34;...no not so much. They are homemade regular VeryThick biscuits.<br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, with some &#34;Land O Lakes&#34; and &#34;Strawberry Preserve&#34; you got yourself a winning combination. Other than that, to me it was just a good, hot, storemade biscuit.<br>If I  was to return I would definitely bring my own condiments.<br>Until Next Time another Fatboy chronicles Adventure.

    	Feels like a comic book store on the outside, and 1950&#39;s kitchen on the inside. <br><br>I shared a breakfast sandwich (bologna, eggs, and cheese) and the famous Poptart biscuit (strawberry jam inside and frosting and sprinkles on top). Because the bologna made the sandwich too salty for my taste, I would shotgun a bite of it with a bite of the sweet Poptart biscuit. I know, I&#39;m a fatty with overly wide cheeks, but try this technique! Salty and sweet all in one. <br><br>Biscuits are crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Gives you a new perspective on how biscuits should be made. Now if only I could take a Chic-Fil-A chicken patty and place in on one of these bad boy biscuits... (*idea*) today I must be all about mixing it up. <br><br>Con: unsure what&#39;s more spare, the parking spaces or the seats on the inside of the place.

    	I visited early bird for the first time today and it exceeded all my very high expectations. I was immediately greeted when I walked in, and when I told the gentleman that it was my first time in he was excited to tell me all about the menu. I got the fig and goat cheese biscuit and it could not have been more delicious. The kicker though was the genuine and cheerful service. He even threw in a complimentary house made pop tart if I, &#34;promised to share it with someone I loved.&#34; Overall you can&#39;t beat blanchards coffee and biscuits but it is because of the exceptional service that I will be returning, and returning often.

    	I received some Ironclad Mariners Blend coffee as a holiday gift from my family in Fayetteville, Tennessee (the owners of Ironclad have history with Fayetteville).

    	It has an old school feel and tons of vegetarian &amp; vegan options. It almost feels a little like a small library inside.

    	This place has satisfying vegetarian dishes, and I am not a vegetarian. However I still enjoy going there or getting food there when I need it.<br><br>The atmosphere is very &#34;Richmondy.&#34; Its historic looking with a downstairs and then a balcony style second floor with tables overlooking the floor below. <br><br>I usually get some type of salad with falafel on it, it&#39;s great there. Yesterday I got an everything bagel with jalapeño cream cheese, tomatoes, and red onion to go. It tasted good but my only complaint was that the cream cheese was everywhere when I opened the bagel, and they don&#39;t cut them in half (pet peeve). <br><br>Other than that this place is recommended for lunch break, or a bagel stop.

    	Came in for lunch after not having eaten here for two years. I now remember why I don&#39;t go here. Harrison Street isn&#39;t bad, but compared to other cafes in the area, this one is easily not my first choice.<br><br>I remember really enjoying how sweet and milky their iced chai was when I was last here, so I ordered my favorite tea/coffee combo: a dirty chai. It was okay. Didn&#39;t hold a candle to the famous dirty chai from Baked &amp; Wired in D.C., though I&#39;m sure Harrison Street Café isn&#39;t really known for dirty chai in the first place. At least I know to stick to plain chai next time. <br><br>The vegan French toast is good. It&#39;s probably the best thing about this place. Without comparing it to regular old egg-based French toast, I&#39;d think it was the real deal. If you&#39;re a fan of French toast (I&#39;m more of a pancake/waffle girl myself) then you should definitely try it.<br><br>They were out of the curried chick&#39;n salad so I got egg salad instead. I don&#39;t have anything in particular to say about it other than it was an egg salad. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t too fond of the Thai soba noodle salad that they were serving as a special the day I went. It was a combination of whole peanuts, edamame, and &#34;Thai&#34; salad dressing on top of (mushy) soba noodles. Long story short: they made a feeble attempt to work with different Asian ingredients and flavors with this &#34;fusion&#34; dish and it really didn&#39;t work for me. It reminded me of something that would be served at Shafer dining hall on VCU campus. (Admittedly this description sounds way more harsh than it should be. I wouldn&#39;t straight up say that it was bad anyway.)<br><br>Overall, I&#39;ve got mixed feelings about this place. That&#39;s about it.

    	I got the falafel sub with a side salad with the ginger caesar dressing. Both items were pretty good: just a little too much sauce on the sandwich and dressing on the salad. It was very messy to eat. Atmosphere was a bit off: loved the charm upstairs but downstairs was very cramped and ordering was awkward. The staff wasn&#39;t very friendly or social: they were definitely not inviting and kind of made us feel like we were inconveniencing them by being there. Overall I&#39;d probably go back because of the vegan options but I&#39;d definitely lower my expectations for service.

    	Harrison St is my go-to place for lunch. I work on VCU&#39;s campus and it&#39;s great to have a delicious option for lunch that&#39;s popular but not packed. I am not a vegan or vegetarian but dang if ever single sandwich I&#39;ve ever had there wasn&#39;t one of the most tasty things I&#39;ve had between two slices of bread. They have great weekly specials--so much so that I have not really ordered off their regular menu much. I&#39;m also always tempted by their vegan treats near the counter. I&#39;ve always had a fine interaction with their staff and my food has frequently been given to me less than 5 minutes after I&#39;ve ordered it. Even if you&#39;re a carnivore this is a great place to go for a quick and tasty bite.

They have an extensive menu with brunch options. They also have desserts in the front and lots of drinks. They have a large seating area and is two floors. The staff is super kind as well!<br><br>It took me a while to decide if I wanted to get breakfast for lunch but ultimately I decided to do a create your own omelette and added fake bacon (which I couldn&#39;t tell the difference between that and real bacon) as well as some potatoes. Everything tasted fresh and didn&#39;t take too long to come out. The potato portion was kind of small for the price but still delicious none the less. <br><br>I want to come back to try the sandwiches for sure!

    	Wowie kazowie y&#39;all. I&#39;ve eaten at a lot of vegan establishments, I cook a lot of vegan food, and I&#39;m not vegan. This place blew me away. Only got to try one sandwich, one side salad, but I think this is my favorite vegan spot OVERALL of everything I&#39;ve tried. Better than anything in Philly. I wish I lived closer, maybe I&#39;ll move. Life changing sandwich, tempeh zeppelin. Even the bread, un-toasted, was great. The flavor profiles, not over- salted, textures, sour, slightly spicy, the artichoke, the caramelized onions. WHO ISB THE CHEF HERE can I follow them? Are they on the web? Can i buy them a drink? The orange tahini dressing, i wish i had that recipe. It&#39;s probably so simple, it probably all is. But it&#39;s so well executed. I wanted for nothing, i loved every last bit. Thank you.

    	I find this place a bit overrated, although I only tried their brunch so I don&#39;t know how their lunch would be. The brunch options are pricy for what you get; we ended up paying $35 -including tip- for a spinach omelette without any sides (not even any bread), a sausage toast and a burrito wrap with one chai. The sandwiches are fresh but the portions were small and a bit bland of taste. On the other hand, the service was really nice. The room is cozy.

    	I love this cafe. I had a friend in town for a few days and we went every morning for coffee and breakfast. This cafe is located on N Harrison down the street from three of VCU&#39;s art/music buildings, aka: perfect location. The vibe inside of the cafe is super chill, which I love, the employees are very polite. The menu includes vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options for those who prefer those options. The first day we walked over to the cafe for breakfast I ordered the french toast and it is absolutely amazing!!! It&#39;s simple but so good. Not too sweet at all, perfect for breakfast. My friend ordered a vegan egg (tofu) burrito, and it looked really good. They also have sausage which they can make out of soy which I think is pretty interesting. I&#39;ve had three different coffee drinks from the cafe - latte, mocha and regular coffee. The basic coffee is probably my favorite, the latte is a little too milky for my taste and the mocha a little bit too sweet, but I would order it again. Anyways, later that day, or the next day, we went back in the late afternoon for a snack. I got a vegan blondie with chocolate chips and it was so good!! It was so good, perfect amount of sweetness. The seating inside is plentiful and includes upstairs and downstairs seating with two tables outside. Definitely go to this cafe in between classes or if you need to wind down or get energized for your day. I will definitely continue to visit this cafe :)

    	I stopped in to this cute little shop with a friend the other day. I ordered the cremesh and my friend ordered a chocolate cake kind of thing and both were good. My main critique of this place is that there is no barista. There is either hot tea or coffee. If I go to a bakery and sit down I want to buy a drink that I can&#39;t make at home. I think once they establish a good hot beverage menu I would give them 4 stars. My other critique is that the flow is kind of weird. You walk in and it&#39;s a little unclear what you&#39;re supposed to do next. It was unclear when to pay and I felt bad to make the owner kind of hover around me while I was picking out what to eat. I think this place has a lot of potential and if they work out the hot beverage options and flow better it could be really good. It is new so I have hope that they can improve and work out their kinks.
