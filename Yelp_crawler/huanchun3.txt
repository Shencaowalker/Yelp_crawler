    	This is my very favorite Starbucks location. All the baristas are simply amazing and never fail to brighten my morning. Seriously, if I need a smile as well as some coffee, I go here. Plus they always get my drinks right. Always.

    	I like this Starbucks though I&#39;d recommend using the mobile order option on their app since this place can get pretty packed! They have a good seating section and a really nice patio outside. Almost always a sweet dog out front too. Drinks are always right and service is good. They also have a clover machine!

    	Good Starbucks that&#39;s not particularly busy (at least it wasn&#39;t while I was there), and also within Carytown.  A nice place to get some stuff done.

    	The only two drinks I get at Starbucks is the Green Tea Lemonade, sweetened with light ice or the Mango Black iced tea, which are both really refreshing and will quench your thirst instantly.<br><br>On this most recent visit, I was tired and needed a pick me up and I wanted something hot. They just rolled out their three newest seasonal drinks: Salted Caramel Mocha, Pumpkin Spice Latte and the Toasted Graham. I probably gave the worse response when the employee asked me what I wanted and I said: I have no idea... haha. I told the three new flavors all sounded good and asked her what she liked. She informed me to get the Salted Caramel Mocha hot and so I did. I only waited a few minutes and my drink was ready. <br><br>The customer service here is AMAZING. When I came to pick up my drink, the barista actually made me a small 8oz cup of the Toasted Graham just so I could taste it and see if I would like it and get it next time. I was not expecting this and it was really nice of her to make it for me. I wish I could remember her name but I don&#39;t. I enjoyed both of my drinks and chilled on one of their leather love seats before I headed out. <br><br>This Cary town location was very relaxing and didn&#39;t have a lot of foot traffic when I came in. The drinks weren&#39;t amazing but hit the spot and the service was outstanding.

    	Ok, so I never understood how people could have a &#34;favorite&#34; Starbucks location. I always assumed they were all more or less the same. BUT NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE HAVE A FAVORITE STARBUCKS LOCATION!<br><br>I came in one day last week to do some work and I have been back EVERY SINGLE DAY since then. I genuinely look forward to walking in each time because the staff is SO friendly and attentive. But they aren&#39;t just nice, they go beyond. They take a genuine interest in talking to you, suggesting new drinks, and just really listening to what you like in order to suggest a new drink to try or something to make your experience that much better. Also, you can tell who the &#39;regulars&#39; are here because the baristas remember them and practically have their drink ready before they even walk in. <br><br>This is also a great spot to do work. They have a good number of tables (with TONS of outdoor tables for when the weather is nice), and I&#39;ve never had to wait for a table to open up even during peak hours. <br><br>The location couldn&#39;t be more convenient either. Right off the highway, close to the Kroger and Martin&#39;s, and in Carytown.

    	This Starbucks is just an average Sbucks, in my opinion. <br><br>I&#39;m not a huge fan of the layout - the main area when you walk in is pretty open, though small, but the section towards the back is pretty narrow. If you wind up sitting at one of the table in the narrow section, it&#39;s pretty awkward when people walk by you (which is a necessity for getting to the bathroom). If you&#39;re lucky enough to grab a good seat, then snatch it up! They tend to go quickly.<br><br>But aside from the setup, the staff has always been super cheerful and my drinks have always been solid. The parking situation is fine, as long as you aren&#39;t there during a lunch or dinner rush, since Baker&#39;s Crust shares the lot. Also, on weekends it tends to be filled more than during the week, which makes sense since some Carytown shoppers park here at the top and work their way down. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t pick this as a place for posting up and working, but for a quick pop-in-and-grab, it works.

    	I love Starbucks, but the one in Carytown isn&#39;t the best.There have been two times I&#39;ve been in lately, and left with a gross drink. The barrister didn&#39;t seem to take the interest in making my coffee drink (frapacinno) sp<br>I&#39;ll probably never go back in there again...it&#39;s the only Starbucks I have been to that did not ask if it were ok.

    	My first time coming here was actually last week. I&#39;ve been to plenty of other Starbucks around the Richmond area, but not this one. I don&#39;t know what took me so long to finally visit this location! Along with the Starbucks that&#39;s 5 minutes from my place, this location is definitely one of my favorite locations! Sure its a bit smaller than  other locations, but it has a homey feel to it. The style and type of decor inside just makes me feel at peace. It can get busy at times though, buts its ok. I&#39;ve noticed some students come here as well. This location is right next to Baker&#39;s Crust.

I only wish I hadn&#39;t misplaced my gift card, then I wouldn&#39;t have had to pay for it. This is a good Starbucks to go to if you&#39;re over here. Everybody who frequents Starbucks has their favorite Starbucks and this one has one of the most consistent and delicious creations and a friendly staff.<br><br>I just wish valencia orange syrup would come back!

Viktor was able to help me learn and understand the new tea starter kits. He was very nice, knowledgeable, and easy to speak too. I have been back a couple more times since then, still love it. He let me smell the different tea aromas and told me in detail what they were all like, the ingredients, and how they help you in different ways. The store is always nice and neat as well. <br><br>Thanks Teavana, I will definitely be backs for more <br><br>-Victoria

I could see it being great for a morning drink. I was excited to go in with my cousin who had not yet been into Lateefah. She enjoyed learning all about loose leaf tea. The staff that was on duty today were great. One of the young ladies help me to surprise my cousin with her first he said while one of the gentleman took his time to explain to her how to brew and what tease to consider. Great service today!!!

    	Excellent customer service, and I can tell from personal experience that the salespeople have changed their attitudes towards selling and are much more friendly and less ready for you to spend $400+ <br><br>The tea is premium quality loose leaf, and probably the best you can get in the states. From English Breakfast to Pu-erh there&#39;s everything you can think of. <br><br>Price point: a little high, but they charge per 2oz so definitely worth it.

	This place was so quick to grow in me, after couple of visits I already knew that I would keep coming back for their unusually spicy and flavorful chai latte. I accidentally met the owner at the Christmas Day. The place was closed but she was super nice to offer us a cup of coffee. Their sandwiches are very very delicious. No wonder they have a good rating! <br><br>Great patio for groups. Dog friendly. Easy access with stroller. Basically Everything you can ask for.

	I guess it&#39;s been a while since my last visit because they had a total menu makeover. The mac and cheese is no longer on the menu and a lot of the sandwiches are different now. New items include new vegan options like the seitan gyro. The vegan gyro was pretty good, though I think it would&#39;ve been better with more of the vegan tzatziki, though the sauce itself wasn&#39;t sour/tangy enough for my liking. <br><br>Despite the menu changes, it seems like my favorite items are still there. In my opinion, you can&#39;t go wrong with the slammer (I like mine on an everything bagel) or a sweet potato chai muffin. I&#39;ve also grown to like their lox. Fortunately for me, lavender latte season seems to be rather long. Almond milk lavender lattes are my all time favorite from here. The Thai coffee is also good, iced or hot. <br><br>Side note: Every time I&#39;ve been here recently they&#39;ve been playing this comically bad early 2000s soft rock playlist (think Natalie Imbruglia, Sarah McLachlan, and Sheryl Crow to name just a few) and I&#39;m not sure whether to laugh or to sing along.

    	Came here for breakfast on a Monday morning around 9. If you are lucky, you might be able to grab a table but it seems to be pretty busy. We managed to get a table right as a party left their four-top. Self-seat establishment...if you don&#39;t mind sharing a table with a stranger to sip your coffee, you can probably park yourself solo pretty quickly. Order at the register and you&#39;ll be given a number to take back to the table where your food will be brought out to you. Bus your own table after you&#39;re done. Get those crumbs too, don&#39;t be jerk?!<br><br>I like the environment and atmosphere of the place much more than I actually like the coffee and food. The coffee is too bright for my taste. The food is something you&#39;d be excited if you woke up one day and your husband surprised you in bed with (&#34;toast and eggs and bacon, how sweeeeeet?!&#34;) but not if you&#39;re paying $6.00 for an egg sandwich called the &#34;quilted bacon&#34; (insert sound of sad kazoo). Dry toast. Dry eggs. Fragments of bacon. Not enough bacon at all. More like the essence of bacon. Or bacon dust. When I read &#34;quilted bacon&#34; I imagine bacon gloriously woven into the eggs like luxurious greasy tapestry. All I saw was two shriveled pieces of bacon bits that had better days.<br><br>I like the rack in the back of the place. It held an eclectic mix of reading material. Like comics. They were low production comics, but I appreciated it. Wait, this is the Fan, I meant graphic novels.

    	Definitely enjoyed my latte I had at Lamplighter. I liked the location and how cute this coffee shop was. There&#39;s free street parking surrounding this location with a 1 hour limit. Perfect place for a cute coffee study, to study, or to catch up with friends. Their menu offers a decent selection of beverages in addition to bottled beverages for purchase. They have cookies and other delicious bakery like options to go along with your beverage of choice. The price range is about average for most coffee shops. <br><br>I enjoyed their indoor seating while I was waiting for my drink to be made. Pretty spacious inside. The staff was friendly and the service was good. I love their outdoor seating area because they have a good amount of seating to accommodate customers. Also the location is ideal for students on VCU&#39;s campus to access easily in walking distance.

    	Like the location, outdoor seating is nice, and service is fine. Overall, for the quality of the food/beverages (which are high), the cost is higher than other coffee joints in the city proper.<br><br>Most recently got a lavender latte - advertised as 12 ounces but when I asked for no ice, received closer to 7 or 8 ounces. Not a great value for ~$4 but tasty. <br><br>Will come back to try and find a better buy.

God their aoili is delicious, I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. Perfectly toasted bread all the dang time, it&#39;s pretty crazy how they&#39;re consisent. I love their white bean and chicken chili soup. I don&#39;t normally gravitate towards these types of soups but I loved theirs! Service is always good, it&#39;s never been bad. Overall, 5/5! My favorite part about this location is the amount of natural light they get because it brightens everything up.

    	My husband and I went today in the late afternoon. Since this was our first time here, we both ordered Vanilla Lattes, which were really good. The reason for the 3 star rating is a two-parter:<br>1. It took a while for the one barista to make one of our drinks, which wouldn&#39;t have been that big of a deal had #2 not happened...<br>2. Apparently, the 3 people behind us also ordered Vanilla Lattes. Since neither the cashier nor the barista did anything to differentiate orders, when one of our lattes was ready one of the people that ordered after us took our drink. When the next drink was ready, another person from their group took our other drink!<br><br>While the coffee is good, they need to do something to clarify who&#39;s drink is who&#39;s.

    	Yo this place sucks. I waited 7 mins to get a coffee and it wasn&#39;t even that good. The people taking orders thought it would be more fun for everyone in line to talk to the people who had already ordered for about 5 mins. The other person at the register chimed in as well. Focus on the line that is forming other than your friends. I&#39;ve been in customer service for a long time I don&#39;t ignore the customers when I see a line forming but that&#39;s exactly what happened.

    	I&#39;ve tried really hard to love Lamplighter, but I just can&#39;t. I love the environment and the seating space is great. A very relaxing coffee shop that isn&#39;t one of those extremely quiet ones. You can actually have groups there and not feel like you&#39;re being too loud or getting the side eye from other guests. <br><br>Back porch is wonderful on a nice day, and I love how a cute little park is in its backyard. <br><br>But as for the coffee, I just can&#39;t fall in love. I am always willing to explore different kinds of coffee. And I&#39;ve tried a variety of drinks from Lamplighter -- the thai iced coffee, various lattes, iced coffee, iced latte, chai tea lattes, etc. I think it&#39;s the bean roast that they use that I don&#39;t like.<br><br>Their food is wonderful though and you get a really good portion for what you pay. I really recommend the Goat Herder&#39;s Mistress! Reading the description might throw you off, but the flavor combination is wonderful. Love the house-made chips and pickle on the side too!<br><br>Service is always a hit or miss. Sometimes I get a really nice attentive cashier, other times they just seem bored/annoyed. And multiple times, I&#39;ve had to ask them to remake a drink (one thing I HATE to have to do), because they didn&#39;t make it with a dairy free option (I&#39;m allergic to milk) or because they didn&#39;t use the flavor syrup I asked for.

    	Went for breakfast with friends before they headed out of town to beat 95 traffic. It was my first time here, and though the ordering process was a little confusing, I eventually figured out where the menus were. I had the srirachi sausage and egg sandwich and it was awesome. My friends are vegetarian and vegan and were very happy to find there were lots of options for them as well. Also, great outdoor patio<br><br>Cons: it was unclear if this was a serve yourself vs waiter staffed situation. We found a nice table outside, and after about 15 mins my friend realized that she had never gotten her coffee, and when she went to ask about it saw it sitting on the coffee bar. Luckily it was iced and covered. <br><br>Overall, the service leaves something to be desired, but the food is great.

Had some good discussion with my hubby after our meal was finished and we did not feel rushed to leave even though we probably should have but knowing that we knocked out a few key factors and were able get back on track on a project was a plus without feeling we were &#39;camping out&#39;. We really appreciate that coming from a busy establishment. Thanks guys!

Placed our order and then the dysfunction began cups started lining up one of the workers had to remake a drink twice due to not paying attention to the little sticker, they were out of half and half a patron asked for more and the lady behind the counter didn&#39;t even bother to look at the customer just waved her hand at her quite rudely. Just one bad experience for us. We&#39;ve been to this location several times with no problems previously.

    	Waited a long time for a frappachino even though they were not busy at all. When I finally got it, it was like cold milk ... not frozen at all. When I asked an employee about it, she was dismissive and rude. Won&#39;t be back. There are a dozen other Starbucks in the area and I will take my business elsewhere.

    	Great location and friendly baristas!!  <br><br>I&#39;ve frequented this location for 8 years or so. <br><br>It&#39;s close by neighborhoods and shopping. Let&#39;s not forget that it&#39;s also near interstates 64, 295, and 288 with easy on and off access. <br><br>The baristas take the time to get to know you, your name and what you like to eat and drink. They take the time to make suggestions based on what you purchase. Doing so, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to try some items that I might would not have and found there&#39;s items there I like.<br><br>Very early mornings and late evenings are easy in and easy out!<br><br>Please come early on holidays and long weekends as breakfast items and pastries run out fast. <br><br>Don&#39;t forget their BOGO drink specials that they have throughout the year!!

    	This is one of the few Starbucks in the area that serves consistently good coffee with a friendly staff. If I&#39;m going to the mall and want coffee, I stop here. Never, ever go to the Starbucks at the mall...long lines, mediocre coffee and inconsistent staff.

    	Great store, easily the best of the three within a block of SHort Pump Town Center. No drive through, but friendliest and best staff. My favorite is Carla, who remembers me every time and never messes up my drink. The folks across the street at the drive through store once gave me hazelnut rather than peppermint -three- times in a row.<br><br>This one gets busy at the holidays with all the shoppers, but the regulars like Barb and Reggie are great for conversation.

    	I went here for the first time on Sunday after shopping at Regency Mall. I figured it was time to finally try Sugar Shack to see what all the hype was about! I went in and the inside was really cute! They had chalkboard drawings and stuff for sale. <br><br>I immediately went up to the counter and they only had like 5 or 6 flavors from what I could see in the case. There was a younger, taller dude that was standing behind the case who wasn&#39;t really that friendly. I told him that this was my first time here. There were no names in front of the donuts, so I had no idea what each were. I was sort of waiting for him to tell me what they were after telling him that this was my first time here. He didn&#39;t. Then finally I was like &#34;Could you tell me what the flavors are??&#34; He finally did and said they had more in the trays behind him but didn&#39;t tell me those flavors. I just ended up getting the maple bacon donut because I was over his attitude (seemed like he didn&#39;t want to be there). To be honest, I don&#39;t think there is anything special about these donut besides the different flavors they offer. Maybe they taste better when hot? Not sure but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to come here again.

    	As we were exiting our vehicle, one of the employees slings water from a beverage mat out of the front door.  Very classy.  NOT.  The customer service from this same employee left something to be desired.  Tell me how you work at a business called &#34;Sugar Shack&#34; and be anything but &#39;sweet&#39;.  Even a pulse would have been nice.  The doughnut options were weak to boot.  Not one cream- or jelly-filled doughnut in the house.  Puh-leez...<br><br>To summarize: lousy, lousy, lousy.

    	The other day, my fiancé was craving donuts. Because I had never been to Sugar Shack&#39;s Parham Road location, I thought that that would be the perfect opportunity to check it out. We were both really pumped about trying donuts at a different place than where we usually go and excited about Sugar Shack&#39;s out-of-the-box flavors. Well, when we arrived, my fiancé noted that he wasn&#39;t really excited about the flavor options that they had available, but we still decided to stay and try them out anyway. Customer service was brilliant. The woman at the counter was patient with us as we decided and was able to identify flavors that weren&#39;t obvious. Sidenote: I think it may be helpful for the names of flavors to be in the case with the donuts so that customers don&#39;t have to keep asking. That has to get repetitive for the employees to have to repeat themselves all day. Anyway, I digress. <br><br>We brought our donuts home safe and sound like a newborn baby and got ready to dig in. When my fiancé said that he wasn&#39;t a huge fan, I thought he was joking. After all, we have had Sugar Shack donuts plenty of times before and they&#39;re always the best! When I went to try mine, I realized that he wasn&#39;t joking. The flavor and consistency were really uncharacteristic of the Sugar Shack donuts that I have had in the past. It was mildly disappointing, but it&#39;s not going to stop me from going back. They definitely deserve another chance and I will be back once I&#39;m off my current wedding diet ;)

    	Sugar Shack. What can I say other than Yum. From the outside to the inside there&#39;s a very quirky-hipster vibe. The lighting is dim and almost romantic. As you step up to the counter the friendly staff are more than willing to explain all of the flavors to you. That brings up to My favorite doughnut from sugar shack- The Maple Bacon Doughnut. Amazing. It&#39;s like a heavenly breakfast in your mouth with the perfect amount of sweetness (I&#39;m not much for sugar myself). Sadly, you have to be at sugar shack fairly early to get your hands on one of these gems as they sell out quite quickly! Fortunately all the other flavors are delicious so you won&#39;t be disappointed.

    	I slipped in Sugar Shack today for half dozen donuts. Excited to try their selections after so many great reviews. I was surprised there were so few to choose from at 11am on a Monday. It seemed like there were only about 10 different type of donuts to choose from. I see they have new flavor up every 15 minutes or so...lol I won&#39;t be here in 15 minutes! Id rather there be a much larger selection when I walk through the door.<br>The server was absolutely great, upbeat and friendly. I picked out  3 different types of donuts/2 of each and got to steppin&#39;...I definitely liked what I selected. These donuts are twice the size of Krispy Kreme donuts and not overly covered in sugar. I can&#39;t wait to go back. My server told me you can actually order your favorite flavor but you&#39;d have to order 24 hours in advance and buy at least two dozen. Good stuff Sugar Shack.

    	Sugar Shack had the best donuts - especially if you like cake donuts! The staff are friendly and really helpful. I was asking for maple bacon donuts once, which were all sold out, so they offered to make one for me! I wouldn&#39;t go there to sit - the atmosphere isn&#39;t great for sitting and chatting with friends, or for working, but their donuts are top notch.

    	I just don&#39;t get the hype. The donut is big and like eating dried out bread. They seem to have the same flavors over and over. You can tell when they got a good deal on bulk coconut because 3 donuts will have coconut as a main ingredient on the top. The flavors are boring and not much to them. We bought a half dozen and saved a couple for the next morning, they dried out hard and the icing had started to liquefy. I just don&#39;t think they are worth the money and the hype. I think that as a local business they have the ability to more inventive and creative with the donuts.

    	So, I would say that my actually rating would be a 3.8. I&#39;m not the biggest donut fan so I&#39;m in no way an expert. The good: there&#39;s a ton of variety. I&#39;m sure there is something there for everyone. The staff was very nice. The guy that took my order was patient as I tried to figure out what to get.  The bad: the taste was okay. Not &#34;OMG I have to have another one of these right now!!&#34;, but just okay. I tend like warm donuts. Also, the location can be easily missed. I went to the one off of Parham. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll try it again.

    	Ever since this place opened last year, I&#39;ve been in donut heaven. I always loved Sugar Shack but I hated driving out to the old location @ Lombardy because of distance and the horrible, horrible parking. <br><br>Luckily this location is bigger, closer, and has an actual parking lot rather than a measly 2 or 3 spots. The donuts are still fantastic. There&#39;s countertop bar areas for you to sit at, though I always just grab-n-go.<br><br>Regular faves: plain glazed, maple iced, maple bacon, vanilla iced w/ oreo, strawberry iced w/ chocolate. They also started selling these cinnamon roll donuts that I first discovered back around Labor Day weekend. Holy. Crap. They&#39;re just as amazing as you would expect. Sometimes the cinnamon roll donuts are the size of my face, sometimes they&#39;re a regular donut size (regular for Sugar Shack, so I guess above average still), but they&#39;re ALWAYS delish.<br><br>As I said in my review for the Lombardy location: A little pricey for donuts, but totally worth it because the donuts are so good and also larger than your usual donut from Dunkin or Krispy Kreme.<br><br>I&#39;m a fan of the iced coffee. They also do a good pour-over , which I was honestly surprised by given that it&#39;s a donut shop, not a coffee shop. (Yeees, I know &#39;coffee&#39; is in the name, whateverrrr.)<br><br>Not much has changed in my opinion of Sugar Shack since I reviewed the Lombardy location. This location is obviously my preferred choice given it&#39;s nicer, cleaner, bigger, and just overall more conveniently located for me. My one complaint for this location is that sometimes in the late afternoon/early evening, it gets hella dark inside. In the daytime it&#39;s just as dimly lit but you don&#39;t really notice.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen a few reviews complaining about the staff here. I&#39;ve never had a problem with the customer service, and I&#39;ve come by at many different times on many different days. Sometimes they&#39;re clearly swamped, but the people who assist me have always been helpful and on the rare occasion I have to ask about flavors (I come here so often I just know what the diff flavors look like now.... I regret nothing), they gladly list off the availability, which I&#39;m sure gets annoying after a while.

    	Sugar Shack&#39;s third store on the way to world donut domination lands in the West End on Parham Road.  Conveniently located about 5 minutes away from my apartment and inconveniently located close enough to be dangerous, this location should be more accessible to those who live a bit Wester than downtown.  Wester?  More West.  Nah, Wester.<br><br>--Location and Atmosphere: Normally I start with food, but the most noticeable change that this location has from the others is the size and location. <br><br>The original Sugar Shack is off of the highway on a corner that offers little to no parking (4 or 5 cars in a gravel makeshift parking lot) and their second offers only on-street parking in the bustling business area of downtown.  This new location has a dedicated parking lot, and while it doesn&#39;t have dozens of spot, it does have a good 10 - 20.  I do admit, if you&#39;re on the wrong side of the road, making a u-turn and getting to the lot isn&#39;t the easiest or most intuitive.  It&#39;s easier just to come from the Cook-out side if you have the option.<br><br>While the interior decor is equally as lovely as their other locations (brown, woody, and hipster), it&#39;s the increase in square footage that is the biggest welcomed addition.  If you&#39;re familiar with previous iterations of Sugar Shack, you know that there&#39;s not much room inside other than waiting-in-line-for-donuts-space.  This one however has a nice open area to the left of the walk-in with some benches to sit at or mingle.  If nothing else, it seems that there will be a bit more breathing room if you dine on on donuts or beverages.<br><br>--Food: Which brings us to the donuts!  Simply put, this location seems to have as delicious of donuts as the other two.  We got 4 donuts when we went, and the yeast ones were light and fluffy and fresh tasting.  I also had a blueberry cake donut, which I hadn&#39;t seen at a Sugar Shack before and also loved it.  I look forward to trying my other favorites like fruit frosted, cinnamon sugar, and glazed donuts that I have grown to love.<br><br>Based on the pictures, it seems that they are doing the daily flavor rotations too.  Basically, there is a pool of a few dozen varieties they make, and at any given time there are 15 - 20 of them, so their offerings may be completely different than the next time you visit.  A good reason to visit often if I do say so myself!  =P<br><br>--Cost: I believe each donut is around $1.25.  They&#39;re large, delicious, and totally worth it.  Buy 4.  Or 100.<br><br>--Service: I&#39;ve never had anything but awesome service going to a Sugar Shack.  I don&#39;t mean to profile people, but the employees here seem equally as hipster as the other Sugar Shacks, which is just the way I want it, haha.  I will say one of the employees stumbled a little bit with what flavor one of the donuts was, but with all the varieties that rotate and it being a new location, I&#39;m sure this will improve.<br><br>--Overall: Never been to a Sugar Shack?  Go to this one.  Been to a Sugar Shack?  Go to this one.  Bottom Line?  It&#39;s a larger version of something that is already amazing, so in the very least, give it a try!

    	After two years of our fate never aligning just right, the stars were in my favor and I made it to sugar shack.<br><br>The interior was simple but classy and the lighting was just right to highlight the true stars... The donuts.<br><br>I happened to arrive just as a fresh batch of glazed donuts were being served up. And though at one point I thought this next comment maybe sacrilege...I truly believe that it was better than Krispy Kreme.  These yeasty wonders had just the right amount of fluffiness and chewiness. The frosting and glaze was not overwhelmingly sweet and the donut itself had a clean flavor. No oily aftertaste here. It reminded me a lot of Country Time Donuts, however, I think it being served warm placed it a notch above them. <br><br>I also had the mixed berry frosted doughnut. I am personally a fan of all things berry but I thought there was no way that they&#39;re mixed berry donut could rival Daylight Donuts&#39; strawberry frosted (which I have had warm). Once again I was proven wrong by the Sugar Shack. <br><br>The true &#34;frosting on the doughnut&#34; was that the staff was warm, friendly, fast and most helpful. <br><br>I will definitely be back and I will make sugar shack my stop to be the breakfast hero!!

    	Great donuts, service, and coffee - nothing to complain about. Although their menu changes sporadically, so if you purchased a donut you absolutely love - it&#39;s a gamble whether or not it will be available next time to stop in the shop. Also I found their prices to be a bit high as well.

    	While the donuts are typically fresh it is not a good place to go if you have young children. The donut shop has no high chairs, chairs with back, or even chairs that are not high stools. When I inquired if the shop had even a simple plate to cut a donut into smaller pieces for my toddler I was again rebuffed. Plan to take any donuts to go if you have small children or be prepared for an unsafe environment for your littles.

Anyway, let&#39;s get on with the actual review.<br><br>What to get: Avocado Smoothie!<br>What else: I&#39;ll tell you more After-cardio (get it, Avo-cado).<br><br>The folks working here were Latino, and super friendly. They made me an exceptional avocado smoothie for next to no money at all (under $3 if I recall). It&#39;s not the best I&#39;ve ever had (that might be at New Dong in Boston, yes that&#39;s a real thing lol), but between the lovely service and the good taste in a state with not much great Asian dessert-and-drink option, I&#39;m happy to give this lovely little Vietnamese place a 5.<br><br>And if you just came from a Cantina and want to wash down your food, try an Avocado smoothie at Catina!

	***so it seems this place had closed down for about a week or so to do some cleaning, it&#39;s pretty clean in here now, also I haven&#39;t seen the regular owners in a bit only the two ladies that help out. BTW the bahn mi was soo much better today than usual, these ladies are something else plus they were so kind! Normally I feel like I&#39;m an inconvenience to ask questions about the pre maid dishes but she was actually eager to help me.***<br><br>MSoooo happy I decided to come here after getting pho at Tay Do! Now I love this place even tho they have the most random hours and cold employees but none of that mattered this visit! There were so many people working today and they all actually paid attention to me when I entered the store (this is a first!) today I got a coconut bubble tea (originally wanted avocado but when I ordered she let me know they were out of avocados) oh well I love coconut just as much! The atmosphere was just different today!

    	I agree with the overall rating of 3.5 stars. Catina is just a-ok. <br><br>Pros: <br>-The price. For 3.75 you can get any Vietnamese sandwich you want. That&#39;s an awesome deal. Also, if for some reason you need 6 sandwiches, buying 5 sandwiches will get you one for free!<br>-Cantina is probably the only place in Richmond where you can get the large variety of banh mis to satisfy any craving.<br><br>Cons: <br>-Horrible, horrible customer service. To be fair, Catina isn&#39;t a restaurant so they just want customers to come in, order then leave. With that said, the workers are not friendly. <br>-CASH ONLY. I almost exclusively use plastic for all of my purchases. I would definitely frequent this place more often if they accept card. <br><br>Overall, the sandwiches are pretty good with a great price tag. I would definitely recommend this place if you are craving a banh mi but don&#39;t go out of your way to try it.

    	I like the banh mis here! And would return probably anytime I&#39;m craving one when I&#39;m in Richmond.<br><br>However it kind of stresses me out when I come here. There seems to never be anyone at the cash register when you go in.. they&#39;re probably doing some work in the back, which is fine, but there&#39;s a big wall blocking the view to the back, and I don&#39;t feel comfortable shouting to the back... So there is usually a wait for someone to come to you.<br><br>Also they didn&#39;t seem to understand me when I asked for more condensed milk in my vietnamese iced coffee. It was so bitter so I asked my vietnamese friend to talk to them. They said something along the lines that they can&#39;t because it&#39;s already mixed and cold. I think that&#39;s kind of silly to not accommodate. That was too bad; I ended up throwing most of it away.

    	There really is a lack of Bahn Mi places in Richmond,  so Catina is my go-to when I am in the mood for a Grilled Pork Bahn-Mi. The rolls are amazing and baked in house. For under 4.00 you just can&#39;t beat it! Id give this 5 stars, but from time to time the sandwich can be a bit salty. Still delicious, but keep me from giving the extra star.

    	When you walk in this store, omg the smells are all so good. I&#39;m not even viet and I don&#39;t even know what was cooking back there but I think that the main thing I was smelling was the bread and it smelled so fresh. <br><br>Their food, in my opinion deserves a 4. I got the grilled pork and pork belly band mi and I really liked it! The bread was a softer than crispy but I liked that. It still had a bit of crunchiness and chewiness in it. I&#39;m just not the type of person who likes to eat the super hard kind of baguette that hurts your gums, but hey that&#39;s just me. <br><br>Prices are excellent. Cheapest banh mis ever. Each one is 3.75 and it&#39;s like a full on sandwich! <br><br>The reasons why I marked down two stars is <br>1. Their service was just not it. The man behind the counter worked at suchhh a slowww pace, taking his sweet little time to come from the back and take my order. He looked like he hated life, hated me, and just looked unhappy. Harshed my vibe. <br>2. This place needs a sit down place, maybe even outside or something. I feel like more people would come if they did. <br>3. The food that they make in the store and sell packaged all look really good but I really just do not know what any of them are. And it&#39;s not like I&#39;m gonna ask the guy who looks like he doesn&#39;t even want to talk to me about it. I&#39;d love to try some of those foods, but it would be nice to have some clarity on that. <br><br>All in all, I really like their food! I&#39;ll definitely come back.

    	Honestly, when I first got my special (#1) banh mi, I was a little disappointed by the heft (lack thereof) of the sandwich.  It seem shorter than usual.  It turns out unlike many other things in life, size doesn&#39;t matter.  After the first bite, I can taste the variety and freshness of the meat along with the perfectly place jalapeno/cilantro combination in the middle of the vietnamese cold cuts in a pate and butter smeared fresh crispy pieces of heaven.  The experience was almost orgasmic!!!<br><br>Don&#39;t think for a minute I do not know about banh mi.  I lived in many places in my life time (among other, Eden Center at seven corner in Northern VA) and I have been eating banh mi for almost 30 years.  What makes these so great at Cantina isn&#39;t just one thing, it&#39;s all these seemingly simple ingredient blends harmoniously together.<br><br>As cherry on top, they also have other freshly made vietnamese item like Gio Bi, Bánh Giò, and those fried sesame covered dough ball with mung bean inside.  I had the Bánh Giò and the dough ball thingy, and they are both wonderful.<br><br>Thank you Catina for making me complete.

    	My neighbors recommended this place- I tried coming once and it was closed, so I forgot about it. <br><br>I randomly thought about it today and decided to try again.<br><br>I AM SO GLAD I DID!<br><br>Holy shit.<br><br>I am not too familiar with Vietnamese food and there was a language barrier, so really I had no idea what to expect. Everything including the menu is in Vietnamese, but I don&#39;t scare easily, and really I&#39;ll try anything at least once, so I ordered the chicken sandwich. Service was super quick and 5 minutes later I was handed a warm toasty roll full of the most delicious cilantro, carrots, cucumber, jalapeño and salted chicken I&#39;ve ever had in my life.<br><br>I am sure the bread is home made by the quality of it. <br>They&#39;re only $ 3.95 - honestly, they would be $10 each and I would still come.<br><br>One of the best foodie experiences is when you genuinely don&#39;t know what to expect and you&#39;re mind blown. <br><br>This is my new favorite place in the world in all the galaxies and beyond.

	Alright, so I haven&#39;t been back here since my first and only visit over a year ago. (See previous review.) Today I stopped by to give it another chance (and also I just really, really wanted a banh mi). To my pleasant surprise, the owners either got it together or my last visit was really a fluke. <br><br>While the man at the register was still by no means friendly, he at least acknowledged me right away and took my order as soon as I walked up to the counter. My order took no longer than 10 minutes to come out - MUCH faster than my last visit. <br><br>Banh mi: highly highly recommended the grilled chicken banh mi (#10 I think). Deliciously seasoned, though just a tad salty. I also tried the pork belly banh mi, usually my fave, but the cuts of meat they used were really fatty (even for pork belly) and seasoned oddly. The veges and other accoutrements are the same for each banh mi as far as I can tell. The bread is still perfectly toasted on the outside and soft on the inside, I think they scoop a little bread out too when making sandwiches because the bread to fillings ratio was perfect.<br><br>Drinks: on recommendation of fellow Yelpers, I decided I&#39;d try one of their smoothies/boba drinks. The coconut drink is fantastic, and I&#39;m not usuuuually a fan of coconut. Not too sweet, as many coconut based drinks tend to be, but just right. The tapioca/boba is kinda a let-down though. It&#39;s a little tough and rubbery, not like how boba should be. I think it was just boba that&#39;d been sitting out for too long. I would get a drink without it next time.<br><br>Overall, a much improved experience. I entered with great trepidation and thankfully left happy. I&#39;ll have to stop by again in the coming weeks, but hopefully nothing happens that warrants another review update!

    	Since I&#39;m from Washington, DC and now currently residing in Richmond, it&#39;s difficult for me to find true authentic Vietnamese food/banh mi in the area. Although I must say Catina has the best banh mi I&#39;ve tried so far in Richmond. I come in at least once a week for lunch and am always satisfied with the sub. However, the service seems to be lacking... there is no proper hospitality etiquette- which is a shame since their food is very delicious that you always come back for more. The man and sometimes the lady who works behind the cash register never greets or even smiles. Friendly service would be nice, don&#39;t ya think? Anyways, banh mi get&#39;s my two thumbs up and service gets a thumbs down for me.

    	Bahn Mi.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I need to say more but I will.<br><br>Bahn Mi!<br><br>If you have not eaten these amazing Vietnamese sandwiches, you are missing a true pleasure in life.   I read a little on the Internet (so it must be true!) and learned that bahn mi is actually just the light and crispy baguette on which these sandwiches are made; it&#39;s the rest of the name that makes the magic.  My favorite from Catina so far is the #11 bahn mi heo nuong, which is made with thinly sliced Vietnamese grilled pork.  I&#39;ve also had the #10 bahn mi ga nuong (grilled chicken) and #1 bahn mi thit nguoi (cold cuts).  All were delicious! <br><br>I&#39;m not sure I want to tell you all the typical ingredients, just so you&#39;ll try them &#34;as is&#34; and judge for yourself.  There&#39;s nothing on any of these that will hurt you (just meats, vegetables, and condiments), but some of you might not think of these flavors on a traditional American sandwich.  It&#39;s the bahn mi ingredients that make them so good, in my opinion.  For you Subway fans out there, this is nothing like Subway where you pick and choose the ingredients as they build it before your eyes.  To get the best sandwich I&#39;d recommend you simply step up, request the sandwich by number, pay your $3.50, and patiently wait a few minutes for your your paper-wrapped, rubber band-sealed grinder of goodness.  Your courageousness will pay off!

    	This is a small little Vietnamese bakery in the center of a small shopping center. They&#39;ve got a large selection of different banh mi combination sandwiches, Boba Teas, and other baked goodies. I tend to stop here when i&#39;m in Richmond. My mother frequents here. <br><br>Their Banh mi sandwiches are made to order so they taste &#34;fresh&#34;. I&#39;m always requesting extra jalepenos and the lady  behind the counter (which i think is the owner) always piles it on for me. Don&#39;t think she&#39;s upset when you see her, she doesn&#39;t smile much.  I also LOVE their meat buns. White breading on the outside and its filled with meat and either a quail egg or half an egg in the inside. We call it  Nom Pao in Khmer. Filipinos call them,  Sho Pao&#39;s.  Gotta try it. <br><br> Their boba teas are also delicious. Very affordable here. Bring cash with you! Enjoy!

    	The banh mi here is good enough to satisfy your cravings, and quite possibly one of the only places to get the goods in RVA.<br><br>I usually stopped by here not for the Vietnamese sandwiches, but mainly for the boba tea drinks. Mango is the way to go. I fairly remember it having an unpowdery taste, so I&#39;m pretty sure they use real fruits! <br><br>Bring cash, because there either is a minimum or it&#39;s all cash only.

    	Holy banh mi.<br><br>I&#39;ve been having the most wicked cravings, so I&#39;m deeply happy that I found Catina. For $3.75, you get terrible service, but you get the banh mi that you know and miss.<br><br>For anyone who doesn&#39;t know, a banh mi is a magical sandwich made from a freshly toasted baguette, some mystery meat, picked vegetables, jalapeños, and a buttery mayonnaise spread. I grew up eating pork belly banh mi&#39;s from the grocery store down the street, where they cost $1.50 a pop. <br><br>Catina&#39;s banh mi&#39;s are pretty decent. I believe they are buy 5, get 1 free, which is my dream come true.<br><br>Bring cash, because they don&#39;t accept card. You&#39;ll probably see me there.

    	I love how cheap it is for me to buy banh mi and an avocado boba. I can&#39;t find any other place in RVA that sells boba made with fresh fruit. Its much easier to find at Eden Center in NoVa. The other baked items taste good too but its pricey so don&#39;t really come here for that. Come here for the Banh mi and the boba.

    	Bubble Tea = 5 Stars. After reading some of the other reviews I got the Coconut Boba and it was reeeally good. the consistency was thick without being icy, and the coconut tasted very fresh and nothing like those powder ingredients. Definitely the best boba I&#39;ve had in Richmond.<br><br>Banh Mi = 3 Stars. I&#39;ve been spoiled by delicious and cheap banh mi&#39;s from Northern Virginia and while it wasn&#39;t bad, it was one of the.. more subpar ones. I got the #11 (grilled pork) and #10 (chicken). To me, one of the most important part of banh mi is the crispy baguette. Their bread was tasty, but it was not crispy at ALL. It was more like a bibber hotdog bun. Grilled pork was good but was drenched in sauce and verrrry salty.<br><br>Service = 2 Stars. The old man looked angry the whole time and was not welcoming at all. He literally ignored me for like 5 minutes even though there was noone else in line! The service makes me not want to come back here even though their Boba was on pointtttt.<br><br>**Cash only**

    	Maybe I&#39;m giving this place too many stars, but this is the only place in Richmond I&#39;ve found that does legit Asian smoothies and boba. There&#39;s real fruit and it&#39;s not overly sweet. I haven&#39;t seen litchi anywhere else and Catina&#39;s is sooooo good! The banh mi isn&#39;t bad but I&#39;ve had better. <br>The reasons this place may not deserve all 4 stars is because they are randomly closed with no signage to say when they&#39;ll be back and sometimes the boba is hard and sticks together =|

    	REVIEW UPDATE: They have raised their Bahn Mi prices for the 2nd time in a year. They are now $4.50 (up from $3.75). That&#39;s enough to make me not go as much as I used to. <br><br>...End of Updated Review...<br><br>Very good Bahn Mi for RVA. Not only do they have sandwiches, but they also have bubble tea, some misc. Vietnamese deserts, bake goods, and sides. <br><br>For $3.50 it&#39;s hard to beat this Bahn Mi. Bread is freshly baked, the toppings are fresh and crispy, and the sandwich size is bigger than expected for the price.<br><br>Great place... but let&#39;s not tell too many people about it...

    	Perfect place to go for happy hour. It&#39;s super chill, everyone is very nice and welcoming when you walk-in. Our bartender was very engaging and made some great suggestions for both drinks and food. <br><br>But here&#39;s the real reason why you need to go, Tuesday&#39;s are Build Your Own Grilled Cheese Day!! Like what?! I don&#39;t know about you but when we discovered this blessing we were sold. Now, I will forewarn those who think the sandwiches are just one price for as many toppings as you&#39;d like.. that is False. Sorry BUT I mean $0.50 to add a few veggies and another cheese isn&#39;t breaking the bank. <br><br>So for a reference, my total for (2) Bold Rock Ciders and my custom grilled cheese came out to $14... I&#39;d say that is pretty decent!<br><br>Now back to what I made: I selected the Sourdough bread over the text toast (I know, I know) and I added mozzarella, feta, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes and carmelized onions <br><br>#ThankMeLater

Not sure what the difference is - this place is a solid 4 stars.<br><br>Parking: Street only. I was lucky to find one directly across the street. I am sure that on busy nights people may have to park a block or two away. Either way, we can all stand to walk a little more for good food!<br><br>Atmosphere: It can get pretty loud here! Not a place for a quiet romantic date, but a great place to hang out, watch sports at the bar, or enjoy time with friends.<br><br>Food:  All four of us loved our food.  My wife had the grilled cheese sandwich, which was very good.  I had the shrimp &#39;n grits, which were good as well, but were more spicy than flavorful.  I suppose some might argue that spicy is flavorful. The other two in our party loved their food (burger, salad).<br><br>Beer: They have a great selection of local, import and domestic beers.  Best to get local!<br><br>Service: Best part of the dinner. I can appreciate a restaurant with great food and mediocre service, but I admire a restaurant with good food and unparalleled service. Our waitress checked on us frequently, only &#34;disturbing&#34; us when she saw that we needed something.  At the end of the meal the manager (or owner?) stopped by and asked about our experience.  As you can imagine, we provided good feedback.<br><br>If you&#39;re nearby, give Social52 a shot.  They&#39;re worth it.

I&#39;d go as far to say it&#39;s the cleanest bar that I&#39;ve been to in The Fan, and that matters a lot if you&#39;ve been to some other bars not far down the road at all. <br><br>Sort of unintentionally, this place has become me and my wife&#39;s go to spot for post work drinks, and I&#39;ve really been enjoying myself there.

    	I adore this place! I live in Church Hill, so naturally this has become my go to spot for coffee when I&#39;m way too lazy to make it at home. It&#39;s a small place with a comforting and welcoming vibe, you will always see people studying or set up working on their own business. Even I have done a work day or 2 there to change the scenery from my home office. I always have felt welcomed from the second I walk through the door until the second I walkout. No one has ever rushed me for hanging out too long. The staff always greets me like friends or family would, mostly friends, because let&#39;s be honest, we all know how family can be... <br>I have even spilled my coffee before and staff rushed over to help me clean it up and didn&#39;t hesitate in giving me a free refill. <br><br>I always get the same thing so I highly recommend it: <br>A large Iced Coffee (even during winter) Church Hill Roast, with ice cubes made from coffee, cream, and raw sugar crystals. <br><br>During the fall I will eat the pumpkin scones and in the spring-summer I order a bagel with lox. <br><br>All my friends and family who have visited look forward to walking from my house, to the shop, each day they are here. And Captain Buzzy&#39;s never disappoints in offering the Church Hill hospitality I have come to know and love. <br><br>This place has become so special to me, that I even bought one of their giant Coffee bean burlap bags to hang on my wall, as a memory of my time spent there, no matter where I go or end up.<br><br>Highly recommend when visiting Church Hill!

    	Needed my usual cup of coffee, but couldn&#39;t find a Dunkin Donuts in the area, so we stopped in at this quaint coffee shop.  From the moment I walked in, I coukd breathe in the Southern hospitality.  Everything looked homey, including the sofa and handwritten menu and ecletic signs.  The gentleman that took my order had a welcoming sense of humor one can appreciate at 9am.  But, let&#39;s get to the coffee: a beautiful dark, sumptuous roast, but I swear there was something in the cream.  It was delicious.  The variety of breakfast sandwiches, quiches, scones and cookies were tempting, but maybe next time!

    	Meh. The Americano wasn&#39;t hot, by the time I walked to my car two blocks away it was lukewarm. It was also very bitter, now this could be due to the fact that it was decaf, but it just wasn&#39;t good. <br><br>But the real reason I won&#39;t be back and I will not recommend it to a friend is because the owner (I&#39;m assuming) hates his job. The customer service experience was awful. It was clear he wasn&#39;t happy from the moment I walked in. I was hoping the nice lady would help me, but no such luck. <br><br>They were out of half and half. I told him, he said, dismissively &#39;Thank you, have a nice day&#39;.  Uh, no, guy, I need half and half. I simply, nicely repeated myself. He replied &#39;give me a minute!&#39;. Whoa. He took someone&#39;s order and then handed me a carton. Cool. I made my drink and then offered it back since the insulated dispenser would need to be filled. He saw me coming and waved me away with &#39;just leave it over there!&#39;. Ok, man. Whew. Relax.

    	I love coming here whenever I&#39;m in Church Hill and need a quiet, comfy spot to read or do work. High ceilings and lots of natural light give the place a relaxing, cozy feel. They have a number of smoothies/juices that use fresh fruit - so much better than the mixes from concentrate a lot of other coffee shops in the area use. Their iced coffee is really flavorful and not watered down at all.<br><br>Prices are okay and staff isn&#39;t the friendliest, but things are fresh here. Ambiance and flavor more than make up for it.

    	Great spot for a cup of coffee in the Church Hill neighborhood!<br>In particular, I&#39;m a huge fan of the Church Hill blend brew they have everyday. Perfect amount of hazelnut and cinnamon flavor is welcome to a hazelnut cup of joe fan. <br>I&#39;ve tried a few different foods they have available and find them to standard fare that isn&#39;t very unique from other nearby options and also hasn&#39;t impressed me. <br>The in house roasted coffee on the other hand is great and the reason I keep coming back. In addition to a great environment to study and pass the day, a free refill also makes it even better. <br>I gave this 3 stars for having great coffee, but the attempt at trying to cater to all types of food availability and offering mediocre selection stopped me from giving a better rating. The customer service can be patchy at times, sometimes amazing and the other times quite lackluster.

    	Quaint coffee shop in the heart of historic church hill. I love the casual vibe. It&#39;s a perfect neighborhood spot offering a full coffee and tea menu along with pastries and sandwiches. There are tables inside but since we usually come after a run or walk with our dog, I enjoy sitting on the bench in front that is ideal for people watching! They use coffee ice cubes in the iced coffee beverages - how genius is that?! As the ice melts, the drink doesn&#39;t get watered down! I always come for a coffee but I&#39;ll update my review next time after trying some food! I feel confident that it will be 5-star worthy as well!!

    	Found this place when I helped a friend move.  Went in for a cup of coffee and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the coffee.   The atmosphere was relaxing and felt like I was visiting a friends house.  I so enjoyed it that I brought my wife back to try it.  We both tried a quiche for breakfast.   The crust was light and fluffy and the quiche melted in your mouth.  Before we left we got a deviled egg and a couple of scones for later.  They were delicious as well.  We spoke to the owner and got the back story of how he got started.  A friendly staff that really goes the extra mile to make sure you are taken care of.  A wonderful way to start your day!

    	Captain Buzzy&#39; Beanery s is a cool joint in Church Hill. A variety of coffee options and diner-style dishes are made to order. It is a casual place where the staff will make you welcome. It is the perfect pit stop while touring Richmond. Plenty of seating and comfortable couches for enjoying your handmade beverages.<br><br>They roast coffee on site, so this is the freshest coffee you will find. Try Buzzy&#39;s blend. Or a freshly-squeezed lemonade.

    	Not too impressed with the $5 egg and cheese sandwich, which is literally two pieces of sandwich bread, a clump of egg and a slice of cheese. Also, the yelp offer was not honored, apparently it&#39;s buy one get one. They ran out of coffee lids even though they are a coffee shop. Kind of a shame.

    	Good flavor but second try latte so hot couldn&#39;t drink for about an hour.  They need a thermometer.  First try it wasn&#39;t hot because the cup was about one third full.  Walk a couple more blocks to sub rosa it will only be yourself that is suffocating hot while drinking great coffee.

All were delish! <br><br>Next visit would probably only order one to split - they don&#39;t joke when they say &#39;large sub&#39; on the signs!

    	Sub Central. I always thought it was a club where you pick up people who want to be abused and dominated and stuff. I guess I was wrong.<br><br>Sub Central sells a pretty decent Gyro with tons of meat. For the size that it is, it&#39;s not too expensive, but I wouldn&#39;t get it again. Especially considering you can&#39;t get a smaller version of it. If they sold a mini or half version I&#39;d be way more suited to it.<br><br>I think with the size and how filling it is, it&#39;s good for poorer folks who want to get very full on Gyro. It&#39;s in a poor-ish area. The problem is that the meat tasted a bit more like hamburger than Gyro. It wasn&#39;t too flavourful. Good and hearty but not amazing at all. Very meaty, and not enough sauce to wash it down. Cool people though.

    	I had a taste for a up north Philly, cheese steak hoagie. I  was about 16 miles away when I searched Yelp for a Cheese steak. 4 and a half stars 2nd generation sub shop! <br><br>Yes, they had my attention enough to make me drive 16 miles and get the truth. Sub Central is the TRUTH! From the moment I pulled into the parking lot until I finished my sub and fries NON STOP BUSINESS. <br><br>That says a lot about a business. The owner took my order and explained the menu, it&#39;s fast food but they had some specials going. <br>Me: Cheese steak hoagie please.<br>Owner: what&#39;s that? <br>Me: sorry I&#39;m  use to ordering up North, that&#39;s a cheese steak with all the &#34;fixin&#34; (lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, onion and pickles)<br>Owner: Oh, you want a cheese steak with &#34;everything&#34;.<br>Me: What&#39;s everything?<br>Owner: lettuce, tomatoes, onion, mayo and cheese<br>Me: Ok, &#34;Cheese steak with everything&#34; LOL, yes that&#39;s a Hoagie. And it was pretty close to a Philly hoagie with the exception of the bread.<br><br>That&#39;s the only thing the south can&#39;t get right outside of Philadelphia...The Bread! <br><br>The Hoagie was great, foot long, great steak meat, chopped well, and you better be hungry because its a LOT!<br>The fries were average, palatable but nothing special. I did enjoy my sub enough to return however. <br>Until next time, another fatboy chronicles adventure.

    	About a month ago, I was having a craving for a decent cheesesteak/steak and cheese in the Richmond area. While traveling along this road, I stumbled across Sub Central. Two and a half years ago, I visited Main Sub Central in downtown Richmond and had nothing but positive reviews for the quality of food there. How did my experience go? To find out, read below:<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Opening Hours- On this particular day, I left work around 10:00am and this restaurant conveniently opens at 10:00am. Usually places are still serving breakfast or waiting to serve lunch during that time. But I love eating my lunch and dinner early. <br><br>Service- I called in my order over the phone and my order was ready sooner than they said it would be. It was hot and I could smell the grease through the bag which was a plus. <br><br>Price/Portion- I believe I ordered an 11 inch Steak and Cheese &#34;all the way&#34; which meant there was more food than I could finish on my first round. The Sub itself was under $7 which is cheaper than a sub of that caliber would be at a Quizos or Subway in the Downtown area. <br><br>Taste of Meat- From the flavors of the grease and steak, I could tell that the meat was of decent quality and not something that was prepackaged and frozen 3k miles away. The onions and cheese perfectly complimented the steak as well. <br><br>The Not So Good: <br><br>Having Lettuce and Tomato on the Sub- This is a nitpick but to me the lettuce and tomato flavors had taken away from the integrity of the Steak and Cheese. Some may like lettuce and tomato on their subs and I never had it on my sub until this day but I will not make that mistake again. <br><br>Overall- I like the service, the price of the subs and the taste. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice sandwich shop. FOUR STARS.

    	I was very excited when I saw this place and the reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was not good. The lady who took my order was very cold and not friendly. They did not cook my onion rings until I reminded that I had onion rings instead of fries. The meal cost me $12.00 and the cheesesteak was terrible. Maybe other subs are good, but this was not. Considering the food was awful, service was poor and my meal was expensive, I will NOT be going again.

    	The best gyros we have ever had. Large portion. Also, nice people working there. It is in a bad area and there are a lot of difficult customers but I have seen them be kind to them when they come in. Great carry out or eat in if you don&#39;t mind the area but I would not recommend as a romantic date but really great gyros.

    	The biggest Gyros I&#39;ve ever seen!  My husband got a steak and cheese sub, I got a gyro, we split an order of fries. His sub was delicious,  as was my gyro. Yes, we had to share! You get what you pay for, plus some.  An order of fries is huge, and they have the best fries. I want to go back and order just fries! They have ruined me for eating fries anywhere else. So glad we decided to stop in and give them a try! One of my favorite places now!

	I&#39;ve lived in Richmond for 42 years and this is by far the best cheesesteak I&#39;ve had in Richmond.  I&#39;ve been past this little shop countless times but never stopped in.  So this week I&#39;ve been over this side of town in a training class and based on their other reviews here on Yelp, I figured I would try it out.  I&#39;m very glad I did.  <br><br>They have a pretty good sized menu for a small sandwich shop including salads and a few spaghetti dishes.  I overhead the owner telling another customer that his father opened up the place about 36 years ago and it has been family owned since then.  <br><br>I ordered the cheesesteak and added fried onions, peppers and mushrooms.  There was only one size and it was huge.  The star of the show was the steak and there was plenty of it.  The steak was chopped fine and very tender and mixed into it was the onions, peppers and mushrooms.  The sub also included lettuce, mayo, onion and cheese but only a small amount as to not overwhelm the steak.  The sub roll was lightly toasted and warm but still soft on the outside and paired nicely with the ingredients inside.  Given the size of the sub, I did not order any sides and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t.  I couldn&#39;t finish the sub and ended up taking a little less then half home.  <br><br>My only small issue with the place was the drink selection.  I&#39;m not a Diet Coke person and the only other non-sweet drink option was water.  They had tea but it was sweet (on a side note, I did try the tea to confirm it was sweet, and for sweet tea, it was quite delicious.  Fresh and VERY sweet)<br><br>I&#39;m anxious to try the gyro as it looked really good, but that will have to wait until next time.

    	Where to begin! I have been driving down midlothian for almost 10 years, and never have I payed attention to this place. My aunt has been coming here for a while, she introduced me to their delicious, mouth watering, juicy, decadent, and did I mention delicious chicken philly with extra onions  writing about it is making my mouth water. It truly is great, the people are nice, and friendly. <br>I also ordered fries, and onion rings. OMG the onion rings are freaking the bomb. I swear its like eating pancake battered onion rings, they were so so soooo delicious. I feel like all i am saying is delicious, delicious, delicious. THERE ARE NO OTHER WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT.<br>I swear I am so not stuck up at all. When my aunt and I first arrived i was like &#34;ummm really, i am starving and you decided to take me here&#34;. Now i am hooked, seriously do not let the location or the way it looks from the outside fool you. They are so clean inside, before i order food i always go to the bathrooms to see if owners keep things clean. They are super duper clean ( talking about the ladies room, idk about mens). I really recommend them. My only complaint is there is no unsweetened iced tea, other than that it was fantastic. Highly recommend this place.

	Continued from previous review - 5 stars for consistency. I was long overdue in visiting this place second time to try their Gyro menu and it finally happened. Ordered a Gyro on flat bread with everything and the order arrived in 5 minutes. The meat shavings are so soft and delicious and flavorful. My partner ordered a Philly chicken  sub upon my suggestion and I tasted a bit of the sandwich just to recall the taste. Boy OH Boy ! nothing changed from last time I visited place with the same piping hot cheese filled chicken flavored sub. Ordered buffalo chicken wings as apps and they are OK not the best of the menu as they were little extra salty from the buffalo sauce mix it seems. Overall, I am happy that this place has consistency with their menu offerings. 5/5 will visit again on my next trip to RVA!

    	This is the BEST sub shop in Richmond. Bar none. My wife discovered it a few years ago when she worked in Midlothian. We moved out of state since then but when we visit we always come here at least once. <br><br>The owner is awesome. He remembers everyone, even us when we come through only a few times a year. The steak and cheese is like most have said, really good. I love the cold cut. It is the BOMB! It is always spotless in the place as well. Do yourself a favor and stop here. The area is...well interesting but the food is well worth it.

    	This is another story of &#34;I&#39;ve driven by here a hundred times and never stopped.&#34; Well, this time I stopped and am glad I did. It doesn&#39;t hurt that they were right next to an auto parts store and I needed wiper blades either.<br><br>Making a submarine sandwich is a simple concept but restaurants approach it differently.  Some places put classic combinations of ingredients on a roll to form your vanilla (type, not flavored) sub sandwich. Within this category, there are levels of quality, from a gas station to a real sub shop (Sub Central, Jersey Mike&#39;s, etc.)   Others go exotic/crazy and combine non-traditional ingredients or over the top quantities onto a sub-shaped sandwich, trying to trigger an appearance on a cable food network.  For my sub, I usually prefer the former and that&#39;s what I got from Sub Central.<br><br>They have a nice selection of cold subs, toasted subs and sandwiches off the grill. I had a club sandwich, which fell into the toasted sub column. There was plenty of ham, turkey and bacon, and the bread was very fresh. I had to drive 25 minutes before eating it so I want to go back and have one that&#39;s still warm and toasty, but my well-traveled sub was still delicious!  I also want to go back to try their gyro. I saw someone eating one while I waited for my sandwich (I didn&#39;t stare, I just glanced) and it looked delicious.

    	Best subs in Richmond! Love steak and cheese all the way or turkey toasted or the grilled chicken sub all the way! French fries are always fresh and hot. They have chicken wings with a kick to them that are so good and definitely try the gyro! My only problem is trying to decide what to eat. Clean fast fresh and friendly is what this place is about!

    	After reading the reviews I was really excited to try this place. We made a special trip across town, and unfortunately were a little disappointed. The steak and cheese was really fatty and the onion rings were still dripping with grease. Maybe some of the other menu items are better, but we won&#39;t be visiting again unless we&#39;re in the area already.
