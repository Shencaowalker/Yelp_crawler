    	I am a big fan of teas and when I first discovered this place a few years ago I was in love. It does take some time to figure out what you like. I thought I&#39;d like enjoy black teas more when surprisingly I enjoy a good green tea more. Do not base your flavor choices based on the tea you buy in bulk at the market these teas are so much deeper in flavor. I love their hot cinnamon tea it is amazing and I normally really dislike cinnamon in large amounts. To be fair I have gone before and had them be closed when they say online it should be open which is very annoying. It is also a bit of a sticker shock because the prices on the list are by the ounce but they only sell minimum of 2 oz at a time so it can be a bit of a sticker shock at the register. This could be solved by advertising this better. Overall I love this place and try to come by when I am in the state.

    	If you are a tea person, this shop is nirvana. If you&#39;re not a tea person, put down your Lipton tea bag and go check this place out. You will never drink Lipton again. They have some beautiful blends and they are so friendly and willing to help you find something you&#39;ll love. If you&#39;re lazy and don&#39;t want to go to Carytown, Kroger carries some of their popular teas. That said, you should stop by the Carytown store because their selection is amazing.<br><br>They have a small area where you can drink your tea in the shop, and they do stock tea supplies, but this is really a place to discover lovely teas and take them home to enjoy them there.

    	We stopped here once but will certainly be back! <br><br>Based off of what I saw online I wasn&#39;t sure if this was a tea shop that just sold loose tea or if it was a place to get a cup of tea or an afternoon tea service. Its mostly a shop that sells loose leaf teas and tea blends. But the staff will also make you a cup of tea which is especially helpful if you are not sure which one you want to buy. They do not have an afternoon tea service to my knowledge. I really liked the list of teas and blends that I saw. I have been hunting for a good mint black tea and found it here. I didn&#39;t see my favorite (Lady Londonderry) but other than that they really have everything else. I also liked that on the list of teas they sell, there are some steeping guidelines for each as different teas require different temperatures.

    	Nice little tea shop with a huge selection! And all their teas are organic, I believe. There is a small sitting area with books about tea. The staff did not seem as interested in conversing as at other tea places I have frequented, but it was my first time, and maybe I caught them at a busy time. I will definitely be back!

    	I love CaryTown Teas! It&#39;s more than just a place to buy tea. It&#39;s the place to go to get a tea education!! They help you discover new things and really find a tea you&#39;ll love!<br>I also joined their tea of the month club and I have been so so happy every time I open my mailbox! They include tasting notes, origin, and steeping recommendations.<br>I have yet to be disappointed!!

    	I had finally had enough with Teavana. Their boring and overpriced teas were not cutting it for me. Luckily, I found this gem of a tea shop! I was most impressed with the sheer amount of truly unique teas! The blends were so different than any other teas I have tried before and they were reasonably priced as far as loose leaf teas are concerned. I have been two times so far and I will definitely be coming back. I was also pleased with the pleasant and very helpful customer service! The lady (I&#39;m assuming was the owner) working the tea counter was very glad to answer any question I had. If you plan on going to pick up some tea I would suggest that you try the turmeric ginger tea, it was truly an amazing herbal tea!

    	I discovered the tea shop from a coworker who lives in the area who purchased tea as a Christmas gift for another colleague.  The samples I received from my colleague were incredible.  I immediate went home to purchase my own and I must admit, I am in tea heaven.  The teas are vibrant, fresh, and the blends were perfect.  I am a big fan of the ice wine tea and since I can&#39;t drink wine at work, this is a great substitute.  Since I am not in the area (reside in the DMV), I can&#39;t attest to the shop.  I can say that the customer service online has been impeccable, including sending me a sample of a wonderful tea with my order to make up for the delay in being not able to ship the one I selected. The lovely note that accompanied my order was a great touch.  That is a company going above and beyond!  I am hoping to stop by and visit this summer on my way to NC.  In the meantime,  I am very happy to keep up my tea orders online.

    	Sometimes yes, sometimes no. I&#39;ve had days I went in and got kiiiinda ignored while the woman behind the counter talked at length with other customers. I had one thoroughly enjoyable day where I and a friend got into a lengthy discussion with her ourselves [about zombie plans- is yours finalized?]. The tea is always good and high-quality which is, admittedly, reflected in the price... but anyone who drinks good tea knows it&#39;s not five dollars a pound or something crazy.<br><br>Ultimately my one real complaint about the place? There&#39;s no bloody milk to put in my tea when I buy a cuppa... and when I asked, I was duly informed that putting milk in tea ruined the health benefits. So... I buy bulk tea hither, thither and yon and drink my tea at home.<br><br>With milk.

    	Their hours are not as advertised on their door or website. Very inconvenient and irritating to show up an hour prior to their advertised closing and have nobody there. Wish I could actually review their teas!

    	I love Carytown Teas! I&#39;m not going to lie, during my first visit I experienced a bit of sticker shock. The tea is VERY expensive, and if you thought buying &#34;fancy&#34; yogi tea at the grocery store prepared you for your visit here, I promise you will be surprised like me. BUT, you get what you pay for. The tea here is delicious! And above all, the service is fantastic. I am still relatively new to the world of tea, and the staff has been so incredibly helpful pointing me in the right direction, letting me smell different kinds, and instructing me how to best make use of the tea I buy. Unfortunately, I simply cannot afford to go here as much as I would like, so every once in a while I have to cheat on my favorite shop. But when I do have the money, or I want the higher quality, this is the first place I stop! I recently convinced my husband to buy the tea of the month club for me, so I can&#39;t wait for my first delivery. Plus, with the Group On it as much more affordable. Definitely one of my favorite places in Carytown!

    	Carytown Teas is a gem of a shop befitting a grander city than Richmond (sorry, Richmond). The selection of teas, all of which are organic and fair trade, is vast. The two employees that I&#39;ve encountered, Patricia (the owner) and Mistie, are both absolutely delightful and extremely helpful. They are passionate about good quality teas, and it shows. I drink a lot of tea, and I won&#39;t buy it anywhere else. Although the prices are steep, the products are well worth it. They also carry a large variety of tea implements such as tea pots, cups, travel mugs, steepers/infusers/bags/balls, tea sets, whisks (for Japanese-style matcha, or green tea), and much more. <br><br>The only way this place could be any better is if they served little appetizers to go with their delicious brews. I haven&#39;t actually enjoyed a cuppa at the store, but apparently that is also an option, as the place advertises itself as a salon as well as a shop. If you love tea, you&#39;ll be swept away by Carytown Teas. And if you ever move away from Richmond, or know someone outside the city who loves tea, they offer a mail order service, as well as a nifty tea of the month club, which would make a fabulous gift. As a testiment to their fine tea blends, they won second place in the North American Tea Championship in 2010, which is proudly advertised on the ceramic to-go mugs they sell.<br><br>Here are some of my favorite blends, which Patricia lovingly creates by hand:<br>- Masala Chai<br>- Hot Cinnamon Spice (the perfect sweet winter tea; it warms the soul)<br>- Russian Earl Grey (my favorite tea in the whole world; it&#39;s traditional Earl Gray with beautiful cornflower blossoms and orange peels, and it transcends description)<br>- Moroccan Mint (makes a great iced tea in the summer)<br><br>I also like many of the medicinal blends; they all have a pleasant flavor, though I cannot vouch for their scientific effects on my body. I figure they certainly can&#39;t hurt, and I do know that plenty of the ingredients (valerian, ginkgo, ginseng, etc.) in various blends have been shown in legitimate scientific studies to have health effects.<br><br>There is a helpful list of all the tea blends and their ingredients at the counter for you to peruse, and Patricia or Mistie will happily pull down the canister of any tea you are interested in and offer it to you to smell, to see if it suits your fancy. Once, after chatting with Patricia for a while about what kind of teas I most enjoy, she offered me a small sample for free along with my purchase, which was a lovely surprise.<br><br>In conclusion, if you&#39;re a tea lover in the Richmond area, you must go to Carytown Teas and experience it for yourself. You won&#39;t be disappointed.

    	I haven&#39;t experienced the same problems as far as customer service that others have stated. The only problems I&#39;ve had with this place was that it wasn&#39;t easy to try new teas because they&#39;re a bit expensive. But what I have had was nothing short of amazing. The Mosala Chai was incredible. It&#39;s my all time favorite.

    	The service at this place is HORRIBLE. I went twice and have not been back in months. Each time, the staff has been either incredibly rude or inattentive. One woman who works here makes you feel bad for even asking a question about the teas. By far some of the worst retail attitudes in Carytown. I&#39;ve since moved my tea transactions to Umami in Northside.

    	I normally like to support local but this place is just not worth it.  I love loose leaf tea and wanted to check this place out and see what it had to offer.  We decided to buy a few teas to sample.  They were all bland and completely overpriced.   I hate to admit it but Teavana&#39;s teas are better quality, have more flavor, and priced better.  This will be one of the few times that corporate wins.

    	Sorry. I won&#39;t be going there again... The service is a joke. For some odd reason, if you aren&#39;t a handsome man, you get ignored. I must have waited a minimum of 20 minutes while the counter girl flirted and chatted up some dude. Anywho, No biggie, as there are other places to go to get really Great teas in Richmond. The funny thing is, though, as I mentioned this to another friend of mine, and she told me of a similar experience she had there.

    	This is a cute tea shop tucked next to Carytown Burgers &amp; Fries. You could pass right by it if you didn&#39;t know what you were looking for.<br><br>Owner Patricia Adams has a passion for tea, and you can see this when you shop her store. Just tell her what you like and she&#39;ll pull out varieties of different blends for you to smell. She&#39;s got a great selection of just about any kind of tea you could want: rooibos, green, white, red, black, and even those pretty Asian tea bulbs that blossom into a flower when you soak them in hot water. I went to get a small gift for a stressed-out friend, and she helped me choose a few different teas that offered a good range.<br><br>Her shop also has tea accessories like big and small pots, strainers, tea cups, loose-leaf tea holders and more. <br><br>Again, making it a great place to stop for gifts. The only thing that could make this shop better would be a tea room where you can sample some of the different varieties.

    	I love this shop so much I don&#39;t know where to begin. <br>The collection of blacks and greens is amazingly varied and every one, of the many I have tried, was excellent. Great attention has been paid to flavor combinations and quality.<br>The herbals are wonderful and the medicinals work. Their award winning Tummy Tonic does settle your stomach. You will find yourself drinking it just for the pleasure of its many subtle flavors. Sweet Oblivion really does put you to sleep. <br>To top it all off, the two shop keepers, Patricia and Mistie, are a delight. They treat you like a person and take an interest in your needs and preferences, whether it is a medical situation or just wanting to try something new.<br>I wish they had a tea room where you could sit and try new flavors (with a nibble) and I think they need to have tea tastings where for one fee you can try lots of different varieties and learn about them. Hopefully in the future....<br>I have served their teas iced in punch bowls for numerous social occasions and the first question everyone asks is where did you get this tea?<br><br>Some of our favorites are; Long Island Strawberry (green), Ice Wine (black), Blood Orange (herbal), Tummy Tonic (medicinal).

    	Visited: Multiple times over the last 4 years<br><br>When a new bubble tea place opened in Richmond, people came to me exclaiming that there was &#34;finally a boba place that they could visit&#34; and I made it a personal mission to have them try TT Lounge, which has been a long-standing RVA bubble tea spot! <br><br>My go-to&#39;s are:<br>- Royal milk tea with boba<br>- Taro miilk tea with boba<br><br>I like more simple flavors, but there are SO MANY OPTIONS for everyone and all of the ones that I&#39;ve tried are good. I love that the milk tea bases are never too sweet for me and pairs wonderfully with their lightly sweeted, perectly chewy boba.<br><br>For the base, they have a whole array of flavors (taro, tea, coffee, fruity etc.)<br>For the additions, they have many options- my favorites are the boba and the jelly (great in fruitier)<br>For the consistency, they have milk teas, slushes, and hot teas!<br><br>The one downside to TT Lounge is that they have hours that can leave you without bubble tea when you want it most, but they&#39;ve become a lot more consistent and you should always give them a call if you&#39;re not sure! <br>They also require a $5 minimum (as of 2/26/17) for credit card transactions or a convenience fee.<br><br>Regardless, I would HIGHLY recommend visiting TT Lounge!

    	I wonder what TT stands for. Totally Tubular? Tasty Tea? Tittilating Treats? Tushy Tasting? Oh wait, the last one is something else never mind.<br><br>I thought their bubble tea was OK the first time I tried it, which was about a year ago. Certainly not bad, and quite popular among all the college kids who love this neighbourhood, including my friend and his sister. We had pretty fun times here, but mainly the company made it so, not the bubble tea.<br><br>I&#39;d have easily given the place a 4 based on those trips, but this most recent time, I took my girl here to show her some fun times, my girl for this trip anyway, and of course, they were randomly closed. Not even closed because they were supposed to be, but just a little paper sign on the door saying &#34;closed today.&#34; Thanks for that, so you&#39;re getting 3 stars.

    	Overall: 4 stars<br>Best bubble tea in the area, but slightly prefer Kung Fu Tea. Great bubble tea with VERY good boba/bubbles and jelly, but average service. $5 minimum in order to use debit/credit card which can be inconvenient, but definitely recommend TT Lounge to those who like bubble tea. <br><br>Food Quality: 4 stars<br>Typically order the slush with jelly, and good flavor with the Mango or Lychee Slush, as it&#39;s not too watered down or full of ice. The bubble/boba and jelly are REALLY good. One of the better bubble tea places I have been to, but slightly prefer Kung Fu Tea. <br><br>Service/Experience: 3 stars <br>Average service. Nothing special, as they did get my order wrong but were quick to correct it. They gave me bubbles instead of jelly. Two inconveniences, are the location and payment. It can be difficult and tricky to find parking, and you need to purchase at least $5 worth to use debit/credit card, or pay a $0.20 fee (which is still not much).

    	I heard this place has been around for a while. Can&#39;t really compare this place to KFT. They serve boba drinks that are just right. This was only my first time trying it, but it was pretty good. I&#39;d say it was the best tasting slush I ever had from a bubble tea place. <br>They also sell instant ramen here for some reason...
TT Lounge	Ashley A.	2.0 	
        4/22/2017
    	2 stars mostly because the service is horrible. 3/4 times I&#39;ve been there, there was a woman working who had the worst attitude every time. Makes me feel as if I should take my business elsewhere, which is exactly what I&#39;ll do.<br><br>Also the whole &#34;no extra boba&#34; thing is a mistake. I used to work at a pho restaurant and we made so much money on people ordering extra boba for 50 cents or whatever. Her reasoning was that they cook their boba better than other places? 2 out of the 4 times I&#39;ve been, the boba was overcooked and didn&#39;t taste superior at all. <br><br>To conclude, if the service wasn&#39;t so bad each time I&#39;ve been inside, I would probably rate 3 or 4 (since the boba itself isn&#39;t even that great), but the woman, who I assume is the owner, left a bad taste in my mouth. The one good thing I&#39;ll say though, is they do have great Thai tea. Doesn&#39;t taste powdery like some other restaurants do sometimes.

    	TT Lounge is an excellent Richmond business.  The two owners, and only staff, are happy to answer questions and provide samples if you&#39;re a boba newbie.  They offer a wide variety of flavors and I&#39;ve loved almost everything I&#39;ve gotten! The taro, Royal, matcha (not listed - but they have it!), papaya yogurt slush, and honey milk tea are my favorites.  The prices are great - though as others have pointed out, there is a $0.20 fee for orders below $5 if you&#39;re paying by card.  They are also happy to modify your order - less sweet, etc.  TT is awesome!

    	This is the best bubble tea place in the richmond area! They use real Boba and not that instant garbage, which is a BIG plus. My favorites are royal milk, taro, and the rose. The hours can be a little weird but it&#39;s a great place to pop in and pick up a tasty drink. Just remember to bring cash since there is a 5$ minimum.

    	Love this ! A sweet shop in a cool neighborhood serving really good boba . The staff are really nice , they are patient and gave out samples of their popular flavors of Boba . Royal milk and Taro are so good! The boba is nice and plump too.   Me and my husband loved the Sweet potato taro and we felt comfortable sitting in the lounge sofa to enjoy our drinks. The drinks are delivered up with a innovative seal that you have to pop to get the straw in , wonderful! Don&#39;t miss this one.

    	while going to school in VCU, TT Lounge was one of the hang out spots I frequented. Boba always consistently chewy and a bit sweet, and their flavors are more inventive than some other bubble tea places around. Taro, Thai tea, and green tea mocha are my favorites, but you can&#39;t go wrong with any of the drinks. A bit dated inside--who knows how long those couches have been there. Would like to see this place get a little sprucing up to compete with other up and coming shops (new decor, more board games, music playing in the background, etc.)

    	This is probably the best bubble tea spot in town. We loved that there were a lot of flavors to choose from and that the price is reasonable.  You can choose slush or no slush; and can add boba or fruit gummies.  Upgrading to a large (which we recommend) costs less than a dollar. Given the variety and low price point we think a five star rating is in order. For something different, I recommend the red bean milk slushy. <br><br>However, don&#39;t hold high hopes for services. There were only two staff there, and neither is exceptionally friendly. You never know their hours, and sometimes it is closed unexpectedly. You cannot get extra bubbles, and sometimes the slush melts a little bit too quickly.

    	Taro milk tea is always my favorite. <br>I have come to TT lounge many times, and the tea is always good. <br>This is the best place to go to when you have a bubble tea craving in the area. <br><br> The bubble tea is pricey, but the quality is well worth it. Be sure to come in when there are not any long lines in the afternoon. Regardless of whatever time you arrive, they make sure to  get everyone&#39;s orders accurately and you will not be disappointed in your bubble tea.

	I haven&#39;t been to T.T. lounge for more than a year now, probably longer. Since the Pit and the Peel was closed we decided to come here to quench our thirst. The decor and the service is the exact same as it was 7 years ago when I first came here; a little bit dingy and not really a bright place and the service is pretty blunt and not very helpful sometimes.<br><br>I got a Taro slush with Boba. My friend wasn&#39;t sure about the Lychee flavor so she asked the lady (there&#39;s only one other person that works there) about it and she basically said Lychee is lychee, you either like it or you don&#39;t.. but my friend never had it before so that&#39;s why she asked. She ended up getting something else. <br><br>The drinks are made to order but unfortunately they use a powder base here but my drink still tasted pretty good and not artificial and the boba had a perfect consistency on them and wasn&#39;t overly sweet. Overall, a good place to get your bubble tea fix if you&#39;re in the area. <br><br>SN: there is a $5 min for credit transactions

    	All my friends raved about how good TT lounge was, so I knew I had to make a stop before coming home. Parking is on the street, and don&#39;t forget to pay for the meter! We weren&#39;t planning on staying long but I didn&#39;t want to risk a parking ticket. It wasn&#39;t busy when I got there, so the owner was pretty welcoming and offered two samples for me, taro and royal milk tea. I&#39;ve always been a taro person and was trying so hard to try a different flavor, but I couldn&#39;t! It was so delicious and the boba was delicious too. I would recommend the royal milk tea as well, and I think I&#39;ll get that next time I go there. Definitely a must-go if you&#39;re visiting Richmond!

    	---------------------------------<br>Overall:<br>-I love the taro bubble tea! The bubbles/boba/tapioca pearls are soft and chewy every time. Nevertheless, the service and the $5 credit card minimum is the reason for the 3 stars. <br>---------------------------------<br>Attire: <br>-Casual <br>---------------------------------<br>Cost Estimate: <br>-slushie with boba - about 4.50 (so they&#39;ll usually round up if you want to pay with plastic)<br>---------------------------------<br>Occasions to visit: <br>-in the mood for a refreshing drink<br>-want a casual place to hang out with friends <br>-want to try a drink with new and interesting flavors <br>---------------------------------<br>Service: <br>-Honestly, they are not the friendliest. My first time to tt-lounge was in 2008 and with countless visits since then, I would say the service is hit or miss. Like a kinder surprise, sometimes the owners are brash, sometimes they&#39;re super friendly, you never know what you&#39;ll get. At the end of the day, I usually order and rush off to my next thing so it&#39;s definitely not a deal breaker for me. <br>---------------------------------<br>What to order: <br>-Taro bubble tea! It&#39;s purple and looks very interesting. The flavor is close to coconut so if you&#39;re a fan of coconut, you will love it. Some say it&#39;s too sweet but I disagree...then again, I love sweets. <br>-Honeydew bubble tea. It doesn&#39;t really taste like real, fresh honeydew but it&#39;s similar to the hi-chew candy flavor if you are familiar. <br>-Mango. Anything mango is good so I&#39;m a fan of this one too. <br>---------------------------------<br>What not to order: <br>-Food, snacks, candy. Everything is overpriced. Just get the bubble tea!

    	I guess it&#39;s good to have a bubble tea place in the area.<br><br>TT Lounge is good, but I&#39;ve had better bubble tea elsewhere and places that serve real tea instead of powder. <br><br>Credit card is accepted for $5 and up purchases, but be careful if you pay cash and don&#39;t pay close attention. I got short changed.

    	I went to VCU and was always a loyal customer at TT lounge. I just went in for old times sake and I am never going back again. The owner (lady) working the counter was beyond rude I was actually shocked at how rude she was. Saw a sign that said &#34;new flavors&#34; and one flavor that was listed was hibiscus. I asked her how it tasted (I know what hibiscus is but flavored powder bubble tea probably tastes different than normal hibiscus flavored food). She told me verbatim &#34;It tastes like what it says, hibiscus. You either like it or you dont.&#34; Who the hell answers a customers question like that? Another side note: ordered the almond milk tea boba and it literally tastes like perfume flavored chemicals. I go to Kung Fu Tea in NoVa often and their almond milk tea is amazing. TT lounge tastes like ass and you lost a loyal customer.

	Customer service has improved a lot! 1 star was a a little too harsh in retrospect but they really listen to these reviews and improve from them.  <br><br>The cashiers are more attentive to each order and the staff are more approachable when making orders.  I think this location is going to be really successful for a while.

    	This place is a ton of fun.<br><br>Not too much to say, but they offer bubble teas (and a ton of other tea options) that are just super good. Their Taro Tea: wow. Just wow. Service is good. Ordering is easy. The wait isn&#39;t long. Prices are fair.<br><br>Their menu is sort of confusing, but after a minute or so, you can figure it out. They just have so many options and varieties, and they want to make sure that they can personalize it to literally everyone who walks in the door. From the amount of ice to the sweetness level, you can customize these things as much as you want, and they are all good.<br><br>It&#39;s right in the middle of all the VCU chaos, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend coming here if you&#39;re gonna drive. Parking is probably a nightmare, and there is no lot. I can walk here, so it&#39;s no big deal for me.<br><br>I&#39;ll be back many times. Fun, tasty, cool place to get bubble tea.

    	Visited early January<br><br>Overall, I thought KFT was a great addition to Richmond, but I think with quantity (of opening times, options etc.) comes a decrease in quality. I definitely appreciate the quality of TT Lounge and other bubble tea chains more. <br>I got:<br>Taro with boba<br>- The flavor was really familiar, like you&#39;d get anywhere else but a little less rich and creamy than other places<br>- The boba is nice and springy with a really nice chew<br><br>Wintermelon with egg pudding<br>- The wintermelon syrup is extremely sweet so I asked for less syrup, but that detracts from the wintermelon flavor- overall you can&#39;t taste much<br>- The egg pudding is super yummy! I love getting egg pudding/custard with or without boba- you should definitely try it!<br><br>Because KFT has such a large menu, you can personalize your drink to suit what you&#39;re in the mood for. Overall I would definitely recommend KFT!

    	After hearing so many good things about KFT, I&#39;m so glad to finally be able to try it! It&#39;s centrally located near VCU&#39;s campus, and the location is very bright, cute, and new. I informed the lady at the register that it was my first time ever getting KFT, and she was more than happy to suggest which drinks were good and popular. I also love that they have a Top 10 poster listing their most requested drinks.<br><br>I opted to get a coconut milk tea with bubbles, and my boyfriend got a mango snow slush. I think I liked his better--I couldn&#39;t stop grabbing his drink to take a sip! The popping bubbles were so refreshing in the mango slush too. <br><br>When I come back, I&#39;ll probably get a mango snow slush, but for myself :-) Other interesting options I&#39;d like to try next time are the Oreo milk tea and the Kung Fu milk tea.

    	I went to Kung Fu Tea for a refreshing drink. KFT has different teas, milk teas, and slushes.  There are signature drinks or you can create one. Customer can customize their drink down to sugar and ice levels. Flavored boba can be added as well. I ordered an Oreo milk tea with coffee boba. It was more of a dessert drink in my opinion (very tasty). The crushed Oreos and coffee boba was a good blend. Service was polite and fast. KFT gets busy on weekend nights (during prime hours). The tea shop is small with a few tables. Parking can be a hassle at times (located directly on VCU campus). Kung Fu Tea is a good choice for a refreshing drink.*There are rewards if you download Kung Fu Tea app and scan your receipt.*

    	Dope spot. Tried out the franchise KF Milk Tea. Bubbles were just right. Glad I was able to find a quality boba place after moving over from California. Very nice staff, one of them chatted with me for a bit after hearing I&#39;m a California transplant and went on to suggest local places to check out. Chill place to sit and work on a Sunday afternoon. PokeStop nearby as well. Don&#39;t judge me. <br><br>10/10 will come back again.

    	Was in Richmond for the day and decided to stop in and try something new, had heard good reviews. The menu was huge, lots of options. Our order was served up very fast. The building was clean. I ordered the lemon strawberry green tea it was very refreshing. The only downside I would say would be parking we had to drive around for a little while before we found a spot but we would come back.

(my goal is to try them all!

    	I&#39;m so glad this location opened. The servers are always pleasant but sometimes the managers can be rude. I placed an order for pick up before the place closed but when I tried to pick it up (they were still open), the manager tried to stop me from coming in. I had to reiterate that I was picking up a mobile order repeatedly. Also, they&#39;re out of ingredients pretty often. My favorite thing to get is the Mango Popping Boba but they&#39;re almost always out. <br><br>Compared to the KFT closer to where I live in NJ and in Philly, this location is lacking a lot. Other KFTs have food. I&#39;m hoping this location will start offering that but due to the size of the location, i doubt it. Seating is also very minimal. If you plan on ordering its always a to go order. It&#39;s also usually busy so I wouldn&#39;t meet friends here unless you&#39;re getting a to-go order.

    	Coming from NOVA where there are an abundance of Kung Fu Tea locations, I had high hopes for this Richmond shop. However, I am sad to say that this location disappoints compared to the other locations. Their drinks are powdery and not mixed very well and the service is a bit slower than the other locations. But they do have all the flavor options and they just recently added different flavored popping bubbles which is a plus! I will be coming back for my bubble tea cravings because the powdery taste isn&#39;t off putting enough for me to stop coming.<br><br>TIP: I recommend either the Lychee Punch with Nata Jelly or the KF Milk Tea with Nata Jelly

    	A watering hole for lovers of bubble tea. I was relieved to find that It is definitely the same quality as all their other branches (as if to say a chain store would be different from the others? IDK, I just always assumed NoVA does bubble tea better lol.) There are loads of flavors and options to choose from. The boba is consistently chewy and a bit sweet. I customized a taro milk green tea with no ice, Oreo crumbles, and boba. Sugar overload. One of those &#34;feels so right, but it&#39;s oh so wrong moments.&#34; I am so happy that a great bubble tea shop is close by to my home. Finally, a shop that I believe will last in that area.

    	FINALLY. A real boba/bubble tea place in Richmond. What separates Kung Fu Tea versus TT Lounge and any other place that makes these types of drinks is that KF Tea uses real tea to make their delicious concoctions. This place replaced the old Mama&#39;s Kitchen on Grace St and is fairly small but delivers the same quality product as other KF locations in NOVA: wooden tables/chairs combined with huge flat screen TV menus and colorful wall artwork.<br><br>I came here with a friend who has never had these type of drinks before but he was willing to check them out. I was actually uncertain of what to get but Mike, the owner, suggested some sort of Mango slush/cream drink that sounded really good. Basically, it was a really creamy ice drink and I got boba as well and it was very tasty! It didn&#39;t taste powdery or artificial at all and would get it on my next visit. My friend got some sort of Honey lemonade drink and said he enjoyed it. The owner was really nice and we talked about why he opened this place up and he said he got tired of his old 9-5 job and wanted something different.<br><br>The prices are very fair as I paid about $8 for my drink and a large Winter melon Milk Tea with grass jelly to go. There is no dedicated parking so you have to pay to park on the street or most of their customers are just walk ins since their business is primarily VCU students.<br><br>SN: we went during VCU&#39;s winter break so there was no wait but I am sure this place will be LIT when school is back in session, and especially when the weather warms up.

    	Fast service! Adorable, trendy interior design and comfortable place to relax and kick back with friends. Kung-fu tea is the place to be. I ordered the passion fruit green tea with Boba and pineapple coconut jam. I love the graphic design of the straws and the overall presentation of this establishment. I came with friends and hung out for an hour or so and did not feel rushed out. Kung Fu tea is a nice place to hang out and enjoy delicious varieties of teas. Moreover, the staff was so attentive, friendly and knowledgeable of the different varieties of teas. I would definitely come here again soon!

    	Yay! This new KFT opening in Richmond will be my new favorite thing about 2017. To me, KFT doesn&#39;t even need reviews - with this chain, you know you will always get fresh, tasty tea, as sweet or as milky as you feel like that day. <br><br>For those who have not tried, I recommend:<br>- the classics of course (black milk tea, green milk tea)<br>- wintermelon milk tea - if you want something a bit more tarty<br>- oolong bubble tea - i like to add milk to mine, many of my friends don&#39;t<br>- taro green milk tea - sweet, what I get when I want something more like dessert than a simple refreshment<br>- winter recommendation: HOT black milk tea with bubbles  :)<br><br>You get to customize however you like with sugar, ice level, and toppings. I always ask for these with bubbles and less sugar, less ice. However, if you get no toppings, you don&#39;t get any of that sweet syrup that its encased in, so you do want to get regular sugar.

    	I&#39;ve tried KFT in NY, Nova, and now in Richmond. I&#39;ve visited the Richmond location a few times now. The place is decorated very cute and is in a great location. However, for my taste, the boba texture is inconsistent each time I go. <br><br>One of my boyfriend&#39;s favorites is the mango slush with boba. One thing i like about it was that it tasted like they used fresh mangos, but it was a little too sweet for me (personal preference). I&#39;ve tried the matcha readbean slush which was okay. We also have tried the pineapple slush, and while it also tasted like fresh pineapples were used, it was very creamy (more like a smoothie).<br><br>My main complaint would be you can&#39;t really customize any of their drinks. I very much prefer slushes over everything, so their menu is pretty limited for me. <br><br>Overall, it is conveniently located and fulfills my bubble tea craving.

    	Calling all bubble tea connoisseurs! Finally the southern Virginia area has a Kung Fu Tea! This location is a short walking distance from a lot of the restaurants and shops around Broadstreet which makes it a great place to stop by for something sweet or refreshing after lunch or dinner, or simply when you&#39;re craving boba! <br><br>What I love about Kung Fu Tea is their unique flavors and the opportunity for customization. This is a rare aspect among many bubble tea places. You have a choice to order certain drinks hot or cold, choose how much ice and sugar you want, and their toppings are everything! You cannot go wrong with the nata jelly and boba combo! Their jelly and boba bubbles are so chewy and delicious! None of mine were frozen or all clumped together, I hate that! Also at certain bubble tea places I feel skimped out on the amount of boba I get in my drink but at this location they gave such a generous amount that I didn&#39;t have to worry about running out before finishing my drink! (+ points!) Also, if you love fruit flavored drinks I definitely recommended the Mango Snow Slushie! <br><br>The owners and employees of this location are also so sweet and helpful. They were so patient and eager to help a couple of first timers! I can&#39;t wait to come back and fulfill my boba craving (which never really goes away...)

They have a great selection of flavors and toppings and their prices are pretty low.  I love this place but I&#39;m not gonna lie all the choices overwhelm me lol. My go to drink is the lychee punch and I always get it with less ice. I&#39;m pretty picky about how sweet my drinks are and I appreciate how you can choose to have less ice and more/less sugar.

    	I&#39;ve had several drinks from KFT, all of which were good!! My favorite was the winter melon tea though. It was the perfect balance of flavors. Mango slush was of course good, as well as the green tea red bean slush. Just a note: the red bean is paste at the bottom of the drink. I didn&#39;t realize that before I ordered it, but it was still really good!! I recommend going in for a quick sip. You&#39;re bound to like whatever you get.

    	There is such a large variety of coffee beans here! Thankfully, the staff is very knowledge and so helpful.<br><br>Everything looks and smells so delicious here! The coffee beans are all in gigantic barrels and can be bought in several different sizes. Before I made any decisions, I got some great advice and tips. They&#39;ll also grind your beans for you if you like!<br><br>**This is NOT a sit down coffee shop although they make coffee, tea, and other drinks. However, there are 2 tables outside so you can enjoy the weather! In the back area near the bar, they sell a ton of loose leaf teas.<br><br>I wish I lived closer to Rostov so I could buy their coffee regularly! Next time I am in town, I&#39;ll have to buy a ton for myself and even more to gift to friends and family!

Street parking available - check the signage.<br><br>The place: I was hunting down some street art when we walked by this place - the smell drew me in! They sell a variety of coffee beans and tea, but you can also order coffee to go. <br><br>The goods: I ordered a Macchiato with almond milk. It was very good coffee, just a bit too strong for me. My friends loved their lattes.<br><br>Service: Awesome<br><br>Price point: Two lattes and a Macchiato totalled about $8.

    	This is a Richmond tradition.  Been going here for over 10 years and the sight of the old roasting machine and the burlap sacks of coffee makes you feel like your getting something special.  Even with some of the newer chains moving in and offering organic and specialty coffee,  you will miss out if you do not visit this locally owned coffee house.

    	I recently moved to The Fan area and decided to walk around. Rostov&#39;s immediately caught my attention and I was lured inside. <br><br>Upon entering the store, my nose was assaulted by the scent of coffee - in the best of ways! This makes sense, because an entire wall is filled with coffee beans in a variety of roasts and blends. <br><br>They also sell a ton of cute coffee and tea accessories (perfect to fuel my mug addiction.) In the back there is a cafe where you can buy drinks, all of which are very inexpensive. Will definitely buy my morning coffee from here from now on. (So long, Starbucks!) Behind the cafe area is small section of loose leaf teas. <br><br>Freshly roasted coffee beans, coffee accessories, a cafe, and a selection of loose leaf tea makes Rostov&#39;s the perfect place to satisfy all of your caffeine necessities.

    	The best coffee spot I have found in RVA. They actually roast the coffee beans in house and they whole place smells amazingly thick with coffee. A must for any coffee lover in town!<br><br>I go there and order one thing and one thing only. A dirty chai. I used to love chai tea at starbucks.  Rostov&#39;s ruined starbucks for me. Their version is 10x better. Hands down. No contest. You want to know something else? A dirty chai (medium/grande) at Starbucks will cost me between $5-6. At Rostov&#39;s, the same drink that tastes way better is just over $4. <br><br>Support local businesses in the RVA and check it out! <br><br>One negative point...why is this place not open on Sundays?

    	The atmosphere are this place is quite quaint/pleasant.  In addition to the large variety of roasted coffee all about there is a large assortment of coffee related accessories and memorabilia.  And much of it is well into present grade, having the genuine artistic effort/authenticity often lacking from the types of coffee ceramics and accessories chainy place like the Bucks.  <br><br>Even the bathrooms are nice.  The bathroom is a single containing shelving and storage boxes, but the decor is such you are made to feel like you are using the bathroom in someones house instead of pooping in the closest.  There is just something about staring at boxes of boxes of Christmas and Halloween decorations that the experience more pleasant. <br><br>So with-regards to everything but the coffee I would quickly give this place a five  But the coffee really did not impress me.  I feel like I may have finally gotten coffee spoiled and/or become a coffee snob.  I got a cup of the ice coffee and was a dark roast and my pallet was greeted with a distinctive lack of flavor.  After a few sips when my taste buds became acclimated to the lightly flavored mixture it was hard for my mouth to distinguish the iced coffee from iced water.  I had the person I was with taste my coffee and they reached a similar taste conclusion.  The Coffee was not band mind you, just not particularity flavorful. <br><br>For a local comparison I would say that the coffee from both Lamp Lighter and Alchemy are far more flavorful generally excellent.  <br><br>My companion also ordered a flavored coffee drink which showcased both a similar lack of &#34;coffee&#34; flavor with the added detraction of somewhat disappointing ingredient choices.  As common as it may be, it seems somehow blase for a coffee drink listed as Mocha to be Mocha&#39;ed by simply getting hit with a generous squeeze from a bottle of Hershey&#39;s chocolate syrup.  Again the drink was not bad, just particularly coffee like or chocolaty. <br><br>See what I mean about me being a coffee snob?  <br><br>At any rate, the coffee is solid 3 but everything else about this place is so nice that it pulls the score up a full point to a 4.  So go here for shopping, ambiance, and a decent cup of coffee, and very cozy bathroom.

    	This is my absolute favorite store in Richmond. I am by no means I connoisseur of coffee. Even though I drink it it every day and my assessment is usually &#34;good&#34; or &#34;not good&#34;. However with Rostov&#39;s I make an exception. <br><br>They roast the coffee on site my favorites being the Kona, Coconut, and Swiss Chocolate Almond. Pricey, but I don&#39;t have a problem paying a little more to support a local business. Hopefully most people feel the same.<br><br>I&#39;m more of a tea person, and Rostovs is the place to be for tea in the fan. They have dozens of varieties and I love that you can get any one in a cup at the coffee bar and sample before you buy. However be wary of the Richmond Blend tea, it&#39;s got A LOT of cinnamon and cloves in the flavor profile. It&#39;s far too strong for my taste. I haven&#39;t had issue with any other of their flavors though, most have balance.<br><br>For their coffee bar, again you can sample any coffee or tea in their store and they have some speciality drinks, my favorite being the Soulless Narwhal. Their staff is knowledgeable and really friendly and always have a great time being in here.<br><br>Oh! Yeah! And they&#39;re dog friendly too, which is great because I like taking my Corgi everywhere.

    	I have enjoyed Rostov&#39;s many times, but their service this week was exemplary! Due to the bike race in Richmond this week, there was no way I could get to Rostov&#39;s for my 1lb of coffee beans ground to perfection. My partner works in Shockoe Bottom, and we thought maybe they&#39;d be able to do a bike delivery to him there. Unfortunately, even that was not possible with the road closures and crowds. Rostov&#39;s staff did some brainstorming and actually arranged to ship us the beans! The shipping costs were about what we would have tipped a delivery person anyway, so it all worked out.<br><br>They went out of their way to get us our delicious Sumatran beans. They arrived in good shape today, and my partner and I are very pleased to be able to get our fix despite the road closures. Thanks Rostov&#39;s for the great customer service and fantastic beans!

There are numerous selections of coffee to choose from and not to mention the aroma of the coffee just standing at the door. The smell alone is enticing. But the aura of the employees and manager smells like sh**. <br>If you dont look a certain way walking into the store they have this attitude where they think they have you all figured out. They will speak to you in an extremely disrespectful way and immediately doubt your knowledge of coffee and hesitate to assist you. <br>So in other words, if you look anything like you&#39;re not from richmond they will doubt your knowledge of coffee...even if you are Ethiopian and roast coffee in your home every day.

    	Very nice little family-owned shop. Previously, it was Carytown Coffee and Tea, then renamed for the family when the daughter took over about 15 years back.  The in-house vintage 1930s roaster is running M-F, watched carefully by one of the two roaster masters.  The shop has no indoor seating, which is unfortunate, but to make any kind of profit on a small coffee shop, you have to sell something other than coffee.  <br><br>Starbucks makes it by selling food and by sheer volume (and cheap beans roasted months ago in PA), but Rostov&#39;s seems to make it by selling a great selection of coffee and tea equipment, everything from Moka pots to tea baskets for brewing loose tea.  They have a large selection of different whole bean coffees and flavored and unflavored teas, much bigger than my previous favorite shop, the Black Hand on Patterson Ave (maybe 15 varieties at Rostov&#39;s versus 4 or 5 at Black Hand).<br><br>The service at Rostov&#39;s is much friendlier than Black Hand (not difficult to beat on service), and as part of a promotion, I got a 1/4 pound of loose leaf tea and a metal infuser basket for free when I bought a pound of coffee.  Customers look like normal, happy people on their way to work.  Despite proximity to VCU, no major Hipster vibe.<br><br>Prices range in the 10 to 13 dollar per pound range, pretty good for locally roasted specialty coffees like fair trade Peruvian or Honduran. The place is worth a trip just to see the roaster in action, but I will be making it my normal supplier.  See my review of Black Hand for the reason behind my switch.

    	Two and half stars for the coffee and four stars for service. En route to a Richmond Yelp event I stopped in seeing coffee while driving thinking this was a cafe so I can take a few minutes to answer a few emails. It&#39;s more retail though. You&#39;ll find that they have a few tables and chairs but it&#39;s for outdoor seating. Inside, they were grounding coffee with their big machines.<br><br>A young man was very friendly and made me a chocolate flavored iced coffee. He asked if I wanted one splash or two and I asked for two. Even with two splashes he didn&#39;t feel my coffee was chocolate enough to his liking and what I thought would be a good coffee and asked if he can redo it. I took a few sips and gave it back so he can give it another go. The coffee itself wasn&#39;t great but I was quite impressed with his help.

	I lied. I am now officially a coffee snob. I got lazy and grabbed a tin of coffee from Trader Joe&#39;s, where I use to ALWAYS buy coffee and realized two things: <br><br>1. As I stated before, I am now officially a coffee snob. I actually had to buy Rostov&#39;s coffee and use it in addition the TJ&#39;s coffee just to refrain from dumping out the rest of the TJ&#39;s coffee. <br><br>2. Good coffee goes a LONG way. It may seem like you&#39;re paying a lot for a bag of coffee but because of the quality you have to use a lot less to make a GOOD cup of coffee.

    	Everything about this place is authentic and adorable. I felt like I was walking home to my mother making tea for me and it was the most welcoming feeling. The owner is just so super sweet and clearly knows what real bubble tea is. Came here with my bf and we tried the honey oolong milk tea and black milk tea and definitely loved the honey oolong more! I felt that regular sweetness was a little too sweet but I&#39;m also Chinese and used to unsweetened tea but my bf is not Asian and he thought the sweetness was perfect. You can customize sweetness level though!<br><br>I think it is important to compare this place to KFT and I would say that the tea here is better but the bubbles there are something else. I&#39;m not sure what KFT does to make their bubbles so sweet/yummy but I won&#39;t give up either of these places for this reason. Both have their pros in different areas. I&#39;ve heard a lot of people who tried Gigi&#39;s now hate on KFT for being &#34;fake tea with added sugars and crap&#34; but you can also customize sweetness at KFT so the whole added sugars argument is kind of null...also KFTs bubbles are just unbeatable and the milk cap is unique to them and super delicious so plz reconcile that if you&#39;re going to rip on the place. It&#39;s okay to love both bubble tea shops!

    	Love this quite small tea shop and the main focus I would say is TEA. When you walk in its not a very large shop but the staff is friendly and they have a cute upstairs  seating area. While I was waiting  in line,  what I am guessing  was the owner was nice enough to give me a small  sample of THREE different smoothies  (It whatever was extra from what she just made) but hey I was greatful. <br><br>Looking at the menu I knew I wanted Matcha or  Taro &amp; I really  could not decide. Luckily while waiting I was given samples of both and I immediately  knew what I was gonna  get. She was also nice enough  to give me suggestions on what jelly would go with my drink too. I ordeted the Taro smoothie with lychee jelly and got my boyfriend the strawberry smoothie and pinapple  jelly. BONUS  when I told her it was for my bf she even threw in some strawberry heart jelly to &#34;show my love&#34; . <br> Both smoothies  were tasty and loaded with jelly,I got a nice chunk with ever sip. Fyi  the added  jelly to my drink did make it on the sweeter side but you can change how sweet you want your beverage which I will do next time. I love that you get a punch card and how nice the staff was . I will definitely  be back to try the tea. From what I saw she brews all of her tea in house &amp; with tea bags but the smoothies are powder base. <br> <br>It was only one person making the drinks  and working the register &amp; each drink is made one at a time .Heads up if you dont have a lot of time or your in a rush this could take a minute especially  if their is a line.

    	I love this TEA place, yeah I have to emphasize that part. Unlike other tea places around Richmond, GiGi tea actually serves BREWED TEA and not that powered crud your body shouldn&#39;t be having. GiGi tea uses real brewed tea as their base then depending on your order, they&#39;ll put a tea-bag or two to get your desired flavor. See, it&#39;s all natural. Plus, they use honey instead of &#39;liquid sugar&#39;. I have seen them use a bit of the liquid sugar on some drinks, but maybe only a teaspoon of it. I personally, prefer this tea place over Kung Fu Tea, which is quite frankly twice more in price than GiGi tea. Kung Fu Tea (about 5 min walk away) and TT Lounge (10-12min walk away) is practically pure power. But hey, if you&#39;re into fake flavors and want diabetes from all these added sugars which will probably make your insulin levels shoot up, go for it ;) <br><br>I find this place really practical if you&#39;re on a budget. My personal favorite is the Iced Jasmine Green Tea!

    	The owner? I&#39;m assuming was wonderful. She asked how I liked it and if it was good as she saw me taste the strawberry yogurt smoothie. Out of all my friends, I&#39;d have to say that mine had the most flavor.  I give it four stars and not five because the atmosphere. It was nice that it had upstairs seating, but seemed too quiet and felt as if they can hear everything we say right downstairs- not that it&#39;s an issue, but... overall my smoothie was good!

    	This place is adorable! They have upstairs seating for you to sit around and hang out. :) Milk tea was delicious! I ordered the Ceylon black milk tea with boba. It has a nice roasted flavor and I believe they sweetened it with honey! I personally like this better than Kung Fu Tea&#39;s black milk tea. The style of these drinks reminds me of the Taiwanese style teas. Will definitely be coming back and hanging out next time! :) I hope this business flourishes!

    	The tea here is absolutely delightful. Each of the teas has a well balanced and true taste, versus the powered or syrupy flavor of some other bubble tea places. The Jasmine tea is my favorite so far. The boba is very good, not too heavy and a touch sweet. <br><br>The staff are warm and very helpful, and the location has an upper floor with a sitting area and wifi. The large windows make it a really nice spot to take a chill break on a nice day.

    	Their tea is strong which is good imo and their boba tastes better than the competitors tt lounge and kft (smaller but they give you more!)<br><br>I went in towards closing so it was barren and the sole employee ran out of lids and covered mine with saran wrap.  It sounds ratchet but it was neat and cute hahaha.<br><br>The pricing is pretty good, I paid ~$4 for a large jasmine green tea with boba.  Would definitely recommend if you&#39;re on that side of campus.  It easier to get to than kung fu tea and tt lounge since the parking traffic isn&#39;t so bad away from vcu campus.

    	In my opinion best bubble tea in Richmond. Better than the chain store kung fu tea, which is also in vcu area.<br><br>The owner learned to make authentic bubble tea in Taiwan and uses high quality ingredients.  The tea is brewed from tea leaves not powder like some other place. The bubbles taste sweet when you chew which is the way it is supposed to be. The texture of the tapioca bubbles are perfect, not too soft and not too hard.<br><br>I ordered honey oolong iced tea with bubbles, it was absolutely delicious.  Will definitely return and recommend to all of my friends.

    	Great bubble tea place! The quality of tea is great and tastes amazing. I do prefer this place to Kungfu Tea, because of the higher quality in ingredients and better taste for roughly the same price (if not a little cheaper). You can customize your drink to your taste, the same way as Kungfu tea, it&#39;s just not as apparent on the menu as kungfu. Customer service is also better here than kungfu tea as the owner, after personally coming to where I was sitting, asked me to taste it so that it was too my liking. I feel kungfu tea has a general feeling of &#34;I could care less if you come back, please just take your drink so I can move on to the next one&#34;.

    	I am on a mission to find the best coffee shops in Richmond, and this was on my list! First, I almost don&#39;t want to encourage people to come because street parking was so easy (no small feat in the city) and when I walked in, there were a couple groups of people, but plenty of seating left! <br><br>Brewer&#39;s has such a great atmosphere when you walk in, people were friendly, and they had a great menu! I got a hot chocolate because it was freezing and a plain bagel for breakfast. Everything was ready quickly. The wifi password is on a chalkboard by the register, and it was a nice environment to get some work done in. Wifi speed was fast, which was important to me as I was working online. <br><br>I will definitely be visiting this coffee shop again, there is still food I want to try, and I have a feeling I will be doing a decent amount of work from there in the future!

    	Nice little cafe in the revitalizing area of Manchester. The location is ok. The food is ok. If you&#39;re nearby, then eat here. If not, then don&#39;t go out of your way to get to it. The interior is small and VERY tight. Not my definition of cozy. People coming in the door were literally standing right over me while I was dining in and as they waited for their to-go orders. Others stood around chatting with patrons, making for a very claustrophobic feel. There is an outdoor patio section with limited seating as well.  <br><br>Honestly, I think they are on the right track service-wise. However, if their goal is a neighborhood hot spot where people can come and chill, they should revisit the interior layout. Perhaps hire an interior designer to help optimize the small space that they have. <br><br>Service: Quick, friendly, great menu with lots of hot/cold sandwich options. They also serve coffee/lattes, teas etc.  <br>Parking: Plenty of street and adjacent lots.<br>Ambiance: down to earth, homey, girl/guy-next-door neighborhood feel.

I got a bacon egg and cheese panini that had wonderful flavors and a yummy latte that was everything that I was looking for. I have personally met the owner of the coffee that they served me here, and was delighted to see Red Rooster Coffee in this cafe. Red Rooster is very high quality and always has such fragrant and appreciable coffee.<br><br>Next time I&#39;m in RVA I know my go-to spot for a casual meet up or brunch.

    	A.J. Brewer&#39;s careful handling and raising of his child is thoughtful to say the least; both the cafe itself and 2 year old son, Parker, who can be seen sitting at the reclaimed wood tables or atop the service counter making the space all the more lively.<br><br>In a city (or culture for that matter) where coffee shops have been setting themselves up to be known more as purveyors than neighborhood staples and friends, Brewer&#39;s Cafe stands out amongst the smorgasbord of more happening, hipster options throughout the rest of my hometown. Moving to Manchester three weeks ago, I found myself all too enthused for the prospect of riding my bike each day towards the abundance of shops closer to the Flood Wall and the heart of the creative district of this neighborhood. I was quickly met with the stark realization that I am not physically prepared for the cold winter winds whipping in my face as I rode along Bainbridge.<br><br>Let me make this very clear - I am NOT settling when I come to Brewer&#39;s Cafe. Of course I would love to have matcha tea available as an option, but their vibrant display of art ranging from my favorite rappers to Hamilton&#39;s Manuel-Miranda to a large cultural figure on the back wall and energetic green color scheme offers just as many health benefits. Today, I ate breakfast before I began my work day as a freelancer for the next month and didn&#39;t find myself hungry, but viewing others&#39; plates leaves no doubt in my mind that this is the complete coffee shop experience that I have been looking for; to not feel out of place or uncomfortable when I occupy a table at one of Richmond&#39;s many cafes, and to be able to be in my own neighborhood. <br><br>Something new and great is abrew in Manchester, and I&#39;m glad Brewer&#39;s Cafe can be right in the middle of that.

    	I finally decided to head over to Brewer&#39;s for lunch after hearing my Yelp friends rave about it and after reading the news stories. I chose the club w/ chips and a strawberry green tea. Both were very good, but I don&#39;t think it hits you how good it is until hours after you leave. I&#39;m typing this review and thinking to myself, &#34;I could probably eat another club sandwich today.&#34; The cafe is very cozy and I really liked the puppet on the wall. Because of the news stories, I know the owner has a kid and the kid was there today and he is probably the most adorable kid ever and he alone should get this place five stars. I will also add I was worried about parking at first, but when I got there it was no biggie as there is plenty of street parking. I can&#39;t wait to go back and try new things.

    	Gotta be real, most of the charm rests on the owner (AJ). <br><br>I was brought here for a birthday meal/coffee catch up and was pleasantly surprised at the amount of attention the owner put on his customers. Generally, I&#39;m prepared for some casual small talk before coughing up cash, but AJ seems determined to extract some minute details from his customer base. I&#39;ve decided this is either because he is genuinely interested in people and this gig affords him the means to engage in this daily dose of meaningful conversation OR he&#39;s actually studying people for some greater research project of his own.<br>Though, he was legit excited to make a latte, so maybe this is just a perfect situation for him.<br><br>The spot is bright and was playing motown tunes that the window washer was singing along with. Needing maybe a few comfy chairs, Brewers still manages to create a homey ambiance  that kept me there well after my latte was gone. <br><br>Food selection: I came for an early lunch on Saturday and opted for a portabella panini. As a vegetarian, I always hoping for more interesting noms, but felt this was a reasonable offering of sandwiches for a small cafe. The pastry case was looking a bit cleared, so I think I may have missed out on a few treat options due to my brunchy time frame.<br><br>I&#39;m really happy to find people investing in the growth of Richmond and pursuing something that clearly they&#39;re amped to do every morning (and very possibly destined for from birth -- Brewer is his last name??). Looking forward to visiting again and seeing how this little corner café grows.

    	When my boyfriend and I went the first time, about a month ago, we were grabbing a little lunch and some qt before we both headed out of town separately. He was off to Atlanta for work and I was off to see my sisters new baby in VAB. We were not disappointed by the craft cocktails and delicious beer shrimp at Rappahannock. <br>Last night we returned to learn there had been a fire so only the Rapp Session was open. It was a different menu but the same amazing staff. Our server, Maddie, remembered us and the type of cocktail we enjoy. She crafted some Daisies (a sweet spicy drink) and recommended the JLo. Both completely on point. <br>We had shrimp and potatoes and just couldn&#39;t get enough. The shrimp were huge and cooked to perfection. #newfavoriteplace

I love how they have snack sized portions of seafood available and I&#39;m usually always picking up a half pound of shrimp which can run me about 6 bucks. They&#39;re about 12 bucks a pound. <br><br>They have a good selection of wine for purchase and a great bar staff. Rebecca was super friendly the last time I was there and I had great service.

    	I&#39;m so happy I stumbled upon this place - thanks, Yelp app!<br><br>After leaving a concert at the National, we decided to look for a place to have a late night drink and I&#39;m so glad it was at Rapp Session. Unknown to me, I didn&#39;t realize it was also an oyster bar - and even better, it was late night happy hour! Rapp Session has two happy hours - one in the early evening, and one from around 11pm to 1am.<br><br>We started with drinks - a manhattan-esque cocktail for my date and draft rose for me. Both drinks were simple but tasty and paired well with our late night snack.<br><br>Our waitress recommended the half price oysters, so we ordered a dozen, raw, and also raved about the soft egg, so we did that as well. She was right - the egg was creamy and delicious, and easy to share. We selected a variety of oysters and was provided with amazing local hot sauce, and recommendations on eating order - from least to most salty. They were fresh and flavorful. <br><br>This was an excellent find in Richmond and is definitely on my list for future trips in the area.

I had 6 of each oyster they had. They were fresh and well presented. Before they arrived, I had already finished they smoked bluefish with saltines. Excellent, and only $4! <br><br>Finished up with steamed mussels morcilla in sherry broth. Un...believably good! All of this with a well-paired IPA. At only a four minute walk from my hotel, I&#39;ll be visiting Rapp Session on every trip to Richmond, and so should you.

    	The short review : This place is AMAZING! GO NOW!<br><br>The longer review: DH and I are huge raw oyster fans.  We certainly get down with the Old Salts, but were very excited when Rapp Session was announced with a rotating list of other varieties.  Yesterday, I had a plan to take DH to Hardywood for the Father&#39;s Day Keg and Oyster fest but my never-ending poison ivy conspired to return me to Patient&#39;s 1st.  After spending forever  waiting, I finally received my prescription.  The sad news, it&#39;s almost 6pm.<br><br>Since we had oysters on our mind, we decided to try out Rapp Session and WOW!  You walk in an there are a few two tops, a four top, a six top and a bar to sit at.  DH and I sat at the bar directly in front of the oysters, which made ordering a little awkward.  After deciding that the Rose on tap sounded perfect we started with a dozen oysters.  Now, I am not sure if this is an everyday thing - BUT PEOPLE - they have an oyster happy hour with 1/2 price of 4 of the five varieties!  And it goes until 7pm!  PEOPLE!<br><br>We tried 6 of the York and 6 of the Old Salts.  All on the briny/salty side.  All delicious!  Following that, we ordered the bluefish dip with saltines.  AGAIN PEOPLE!  You are missing out on something amazing if you do not drive right over there today and put this in your mouth.  And at only $4 it is a STEAL.  We were told that they smoke the bluefish 1st which has to be the secret, or maybe the secret is that it&#39;s just delicious which means that now there is no secret.  We would&#39;ve liked a few more saltines just to make it last longer. (Tip: we were told that we could call a day ahead and order a larger container for take out.)<br><br>After that, what else, more oysters!  This time we tried the Stingrays and yet more York.  If you thought that was it, you do not know me very well.  Recently I have been on a steamed clam kick so I had to find out how these tasted.  Well, if you like steamed clams, this dish will make you love them!  They came with a vermouth and herb broth and two nice pieces of bread to soak it all up.  If I had anything to say here, it would be that you should double or triple your order.  6 clams go fast and you will really want more.<br><br>Seriously AMAZING! GO NOW!

    	This place hasn&#39;t been open long but I&#39;ve already been here 3 times so far!  Rapp session is located right next to Rappahannock but every time I&#39;ve been it&#39;s been extremely quiet comparatively which I hope Rapp Session can still stay a secret for a bit longer.<br><br>Each time I&#39;ve been to Rapp Session, my friends and I will split a lot of the small plates which is how I enjoy eating.  I&#39;ve always ordered the oysters which are delicious and super fresh.  And THE MUSSELS - you must order the mussels!  My first two visits the mussels come in this tomato based broth with a couple slices of bread.  After my first time eating these mussels I dreamt about them for a couple weeks and ended up going back with a different set of friends who also then became obsessed.  I ended up ordering some mussels to go for my roommate who then devoured them in less than a minute when I got home.  The third visit, the broth was a little different - not sure if they change it based on the seasons as it was now becoming much warmer into the summer months.  The potatoes are delicious as they are served cold with a spicy dipping sauce.  The last time I came, we ordered some of the meats which were fine.  I would have rather just ordered more oysters and mussels.  <br><br>The staff is excellent, great, and friendly.  I&#39;m drooling while writing this review because I can&#39;t wait to go back and have those amazing mussels again.

    	Latte and a croissant sandwich - delicious - place was quiet @ 930am on a Saturday - service was quick, folks were friendly and after looking at the menu I&#39;m coming back for brunch!  The ceviche and cocktails are a big draw. The ambiance and decor was great as well - calm and rustic. And like others I had no idea it was there and the name is kinda weird.

    	Rapp Session was a treat and a half! I wanted to try something new, so I went to Rapp Session to drink tea and work one day last week. It is the perfect for oasis for doing just that. <br><br>It is everything you want a Richmond coffee shop to be. It&#39;s quaint, scenic, and comfortable. I could have stayed in there all day if I had the time. I love that it&#39;s a coffee shop by day and oyster saloon and cocktail lounge by night. I can&#39;t wait to see how it transforms in the evening hours! <br><br>This is going to be a favorite spot for me, no matter the time of day. Already looking forward to going back!

	Get those mussels! The best in town. Only $7 for a half pound!!!! <br>Also those drinks will keep you coming back for more. The cocktails use local gin and local bourbon. Add the variety of bitters and flavors, and you&#39;ve got great drinks. <br>If you&#39;re down for a salty snack add those sardines, an under-appreciated fish.

    	Read a review on this place in the paper. Since my wife and I love raw oysters we thought we would give it a try. We ordered a dozen oysters based on the recommendation from Taylor who is the bartender. Not sure which variety we had but they were fantastic.  Then we had a smoked blue fish dip which was out of this world. I recommend you try the sparkling Rose&#39; on tap. Beer selection is good. Which they had more on tap though. Service was excellent. Taylor tended to our needs. We will definitely be returning.

    	RS is great, both as a coffee and pastry stop, or for happy hour drinks and oysters. *bonus- HH lasts an hour longer than Rappahannock next door, so if you are adventurous, you can hit both. <br><br>Sparking rose is great with oysters. The punch of the day is strong and not overly sweet, as punch can be. An escargot special was strange served with citrus on a thick green sauce, but I was thankful, because although you can&#39;t go wrong with garlic butter, as a frequent restaurant visitor, being surprised is fairly rare. Ceviche was really fresh. <br><br>The atmosphere is like a stylish vintage hallway, and love the tile in the bathrooms.<br><br>Cheers-

    	First, it is literally right next door to Rappahannock! You can also enter through a shared door from inside Rappahannocks restauraunt side. (My husband and I didn&#39;t realize this and drove around a bit because we missed it!)<br><br>This is Rappahannocks new venture.. And I&#39;m obsessed! We stopped in here for drinks and oysters before a dinner planned elsewhere. We should have just stayed and eaten more oysters and small plates :)<br><br>I love the ambiance and feel.. It&#39;s casual, romantic and welcoming. Also- the bar has hooks for purses/coats. Major plus for the ladies!! The oysters were (of course) delicious. They had Tangier oysters on the menu which was exciting being I have family from there. My husband and I shared the oysters and Rockfish Ceviche, which was equally delicious. I also had a glass of the Brut Rose from WA,US on the menu. <br><br>Overall consenus- this place is brilliant. Attentive staff, quality freah seafood, and smart wine menu. We&#39;ll be back.

    	My wife heard of Charm School and wanted to get some ice cream, so off we went. <br><br>When we walked in, we immediately encountered the incredibly long line; I guess we weren&#39;t the only couple wanting ice cream. <br><br>While the wait was long, and not my favorite part of the experience, it did give me the chance check out the decor. Everything looked brand new and was themed based on an old old-timey schoolhouse.<br><br>Once we did reach the counter, I sampled a few flavors, and everything I tasted was very good. However, once I made my choice, I was informed any vegan flavors costed an extra dollar. Being a cheapskate and an omnivore, I opted for another flavor. But any additional toppings, excluding the free sprinkles, costs an extra dollar. This could quickly rake up the bill. <br><br>The ice cream was extremely good, which I would highly recommend to anyone in Richmond.

    	I loved that Charm school had different flavors like thai iced tea and earl gray tea. Personally, these specific flavors aren&#39;t as sweet compared to other flavors so it&#39;s great for people who are looking for a more cleaner/lighter desert. The marshmallow fluff that you can choose to get was also a delicious plus! The slightly burnt/toasted taste was a pleasant addition to the taste of the ice cream.<br><br>I also liked the environment of CS; it&#39;s decorated in the theme of a &#34;school&#34; and has various books and decoration to supplement the theme. The area is simply furnished and looks really clean/bright. <br><br>To get an idea on price, my dad ordered a double scoop in their homemade cones and I ordered a single scoop of thai iced tea in their cones topped with marshmallow fluff and we paid a little over $10.

    	This ice cream shop truly exceeded my expectations! I originally came for the Richmond mural outside their store, and for an ice cream cone that was on fire, but unfortunately that pic was just for show on their Yelp haha (it was toasted marshmallow btw and I still completely recommend!)<br><br>I was welcomed into Charm School by some of the friendliest staff that always has a smile on their face when I come to visit. They are glad to provide you with as many samples as you want. You&#39;ll definitely need them cause they have a handful of unique flavors (cereal milk, toast and jam, cinnadoodle, and vegan options to name a few), but because their ice cream perfectly captures the flavors they&#39;re titled after, I won&#39;t be surprised if you find what you want after only one sample. Not only do the fresh flavors remind you of exactly what they are, but their HOMEMADE ice cream cones really top it all off. Light &amp; crispy, the cones are probably what has truly set them apart from other ice cream shops, in addition to their flavors that always have the perfect essence of the taste they&#39;re aiming for without being too overpowering or artificial.<br><br>Charm School is one of the best parts of Richmond and I&#39;m so glad I discovered it!

    	When I first heard about Charm School from a friend I&#39;ll admit I did an eye roll. An ice cream store that brands itself as a &#34;social club&#34; seemed a little silly to me, so poo-pooed it for a few months. After a colleague snapped me some pictures of their flavors and his adorable sundae I went to Charm School the next day and I have to put my foot in my mouth--it was really good! They have incredibly unique flavors I have not seen anywhere else (Orange Cardamom, Thai Tea, Vegan Earl Grey, Cereal Milk). This is a great place for vegans and people who can&#39;t do lactose--there&#39;s at least 3-4 flavors that are suitable for you folks and they taste just as good as the regular stuff. <br><br>The space is huge and open and a great place to take a large group of people. The decor is a little overkill, but it&#39;s cute at the same time. I can&#39;t fault them for keeping with the motif. It has definitely grown on me. The staff are pleasant and will let you try any flavor. Prices are a little high, but quality is high too, so it seems justified. I suggest getting their adorable sundaes or a made in-store waffle cone. I&#39;ve been back a few times since my first visit and each time has been really enjoyable.

    	This is where Quirk used to be. So they revamped the place into this cute, fun, open, and inviting space for some delicious ice cream! Think tall ceilings and long lunch tables. And oh my, it smells so sweet and warm once you step inside. <br><br>When I went they had unique flavors such as avocado, orange cardamom, vegan flavors, etc. I ended up getting the cinnadoodle with toasted marshmallow fluff on top; ice cream tasted literally like a snicker doodle!! But I don&#39;t recommend the fluff; too sweet and it didn&#39;t add much to my ice cream because the ice cream was already so good on its own. And I usually don&#39;t like getting waffle cones but I opted for one because it was handmade so why not. Since its handmade, the shell is thinner and softer than the normal hard shell waffle cones. Highly recommend getting a waffle cone here!<br><br>Definitely worth the hype here! Super cool spot for some ice cream.

    	The smell that hits you as you walk into Charm School is fantastic. The sweet aroma of the freshly made waffle cone just makes my mouth water every time I come here. <br><br>The ice cream that they are churning out here is top notch (hehe). Apparently the owner went to school specifically to study ice cream. All those years of hard work have definitely paid off and I think Charm School produces the best ice cream in Richmond. The ice cream itself is nicely dense, smooth, and creamy. <br><br>They offer many of the typical flavors such as your chocolate, vanilla, and mint varieties as well as novel ones as well such as orange cardamon, toast and jam, and ginger. All of the flavors I&#39;ve tried have been great, but the ginger and grapefruit brulee have been my favorites so far. Unfortunately, they change up their flavors frequently so they aren&#39;t always there. That&#39;s ok though because I love exploring new and unique ice cream flavors! The flavors aren&#39;t that intense and the base of the ice cream is super creamy so most of the flavors will go well with one another. The servers even make suggestions on which flavors should go on top of the other which was very thoughtful of them. <br><br>Their toppings list is simple with most (aside from the sprinkles) being made in house with the toasted marshmallow fluff being the most unique. They also offer cookies, ice cream sandwiches, and milk shakes. <br><br>As the weather get warmer, this place is surely going to be packed so I would recommend checking out this place before it gets too crazy!

    	A super cute place with super delicious ice cream, what more could you ask for?!!  Charm School serves up awesome homemade ice cream, both traditional and vegan.  There&#39;s always a huge selection of flavors, I believe they rotate the flavors weekly, but there&#39;s always something unique, such as Orange Cardamom or Ginger flavored ice creams.<br><br>I&#39;ve had the pleasure of trying the Cereal Milk, which was silky smooth milk flavored ice cream.  I think the milk was flavored with Corn Flakes, but I&#39;m not 100% sure.  It was still tasty though! I&#39;ve also tried the Vegan Peanut Butter Cup ice cream, which had a harder texture, but it was very rich and decadent.  I definitely appreciate the fact that there are vegan options, it&#39;s hard to find dairy free ice cream options outside of a grocery store.  For some of the items, you wouldn&#39;t even suspect they were vegan!  Such as the vegan waffle cones or the marshmallow fluff.  Speaking of marshmallow fluff, YOU SHOULD SO GET IT.  It&#39;s an extra dollar, but it&#39;s so worth it.  They add a little dollop to the top of your ice cream and take a blowtorch to it so it gets slightly toasted, and it makes your ice cream that much more delicious.<br><br>The prices are reasonable, but once you start adding toppings and consider the vegan options, it can get pricey.  But given the fact that everything is homemade, it&#39;s definitely worth trying.  Not only that, but you get to enjoy your ice cream in a very nice, open space with plenty of tables and cute pastel colors everywhere.  If you&#39;re an ice cream lover in Richmond, definitely give this place a try! I can&#39;t wait to try more of their flavors.

    	Great new place for ice cream! They have some unique flavors that rotate. I fell in love with the honey and lemon poppyseed! However, they were gone when I went back. But at least that made me try the PB&amp;J which was also good. Fear not, if you can&#39;t decide they let you get tons of samples 1st. I haven&#39;t tried the waffle cone yet, but I did try the toasted fluff and I am definitely a fan.

    	In honor of Bev&#39;s reopening this week, I thought it was important to communicate that Charm School has NO PEERS in the Richmond ice cream scene. Okay, maybe I&#39;m being petty, but don&#39;t lose focus, CS is a completely unique ice cream experience.<br><br>As a lactose-intolerant ice cream eater, &#34;immediate regret&#34; was my ice cream life here in RVA. I accepted that there were really no flavors worth the pain, the discomfort, or the mouth disappointment. Sure, I have a heightened expectation of the food that ruins the rest of my day, but we didn&#39;t have any places really challenging the basic flavors I could grab at the grocery store. <br><br>So when I get wind there&#39;s a new spot offering waffle cones they make in front of you with vegan flavors and cute AF branding, I&#39;m there. <br>Okay, more than just daily vegan flavors, their flavor offering over all is complex, interesting, and challenging the traditional. I really couldn&#39;t be more pleased with how on-trend and refined the offering is here.<br><br>But hi, hello, it&#39;s so much more than that. <br>I got the chance to chit chat hard with the managers about everything that brought them to make Charm School and I was pumped on the sheer knowledge of the scene, baking, and the the deep disgust for Christina Tosi and her secret gelatin in Milkbar&#39;s ice cream. For me, Charm School is a champion for an equal experience of ice cream for all.<br><br>This is the ice cream dream, you guys.

    	Visited January 12, 2017<br><br>For those of you who are Richmond locals, you know that there was a huge ice-cream hole in our hearts (and stomachs) that went unfilled when Bev&#39;s closed to get it back running after the fire and Gelati Celesti is just a tad too far to drive (and quite honestly, sometimes Talenti just doesn&#39;t cut it!) <br>I knew I had to find a new place for ice-cream and Charm School was one of the places I found, and I absolutely adore it. <br><br>I tried a few flavors, vegan and non-vegan and they were all equally creamy and flavorful. There are many options with a few really unique ones thrown in. Because everyone has different tastes, I would recommend just asking if you can try a few flavors- choose the one you like the most! I ended up going with the toast &amp; jam. It had a warm caramel/vanilla tasting base and the most incredible raspberry sauce mixed throughout. If you don&#39;t see much raspberry sauce in the ice cream (sometimes happens when they get busy), don&#39;t fret!- I think they have a bottle of it and they just have to add some in. The icecream had the perfect balance between sweetness, creaminess, and a bit of tartness to cut through it.<br><br>Even though I loved their icecream, the best part was the toasted marshmallow fluff. If you like smores or just want to be a bit more indulgent, you should definitely try it! It&#39;s cute, but not a must- I don&#39;t feel like it lended that much more to the icecream itself. <br><br>The interior is super cute and has an &#34;inviting sterility&#34; to it with the light color scheme they have going on. They definitely stepped up the game when it comes to ice-cream.<br><br>Visit, try some different flavors or grab your go-to. Your longing for icecream will thank you :)

    	This is an amaaaaazing ice cream shop located in a bustling block of Broad Street near Quirk Hotel. I stopped in a couple of weeks ago when they first opened and was floored by the looks of the place. The owners are also just as sweet as their treats. I just discovered that I have a milk allergy, so ice cream has sadly become my enemy overnight. I was elated to see that Charm School has plenty of dairy free offerings for people like me! I tried the peppermint, chocolate, and a couple of other flavors that were just magical. Because it was a cold day, I didn&#39;t end up buying ice cream. Rather, I bought one of the vegan chocolate chip cookies and ate the mess out of that thing while walking in and out of shops on the block. It rivaled any &#34;normal&#34; chocolate chip cookie that I&#39;ve ever had. It literally made my day! <br><br>This would be the perfect place to stop in whenever you&#39;re in the area. I can see it being especially poppin&#39; during First Fridays!

    	Charm School combines my two loves: sweets and aesthetics. So basically this place is very Instagram-worthy. (Yes, I am a millennial.)<br><br>This space used to be where Quirk Gallery was so it&#39;s very large and open. The interior is really minimal. It has white walls with accents of pale green (and pink in the back!) This place is so cool, I feel like it should be somewhere in New York rather than here in Richmond.<br><br>The ice cream is also really good. I can tell that they use high quality ingredients. It definitely tastes more &#34;expensive&#34; (for lack of a better word) than other ice cream places in the area.<br><br>I tried their candy cane ice cream - which is vegan - with vegan fluff. Their vegan ice cream is really good! It tastes more or less like normal ice cream (though I tried their non-vegan ice cream as well and it still tastes a tiny bit better.) The fluff is also good, but you can tell it&#39;s a bit different from normal marshmallow fluff. I thought it was really cool that they torch the fluff for you - it makes it feel really special.<br><br>Everything here is so aesthetically pleasing, I am really anxious to return and take tons of pictures of the ice cream and the space itself!

    	Fresh waffle cones made and rolled in front of you, and yummy ice cream flavors all around. It&#39;s a cute place decorated with a classroom theme, bringing out your inner nerd with the bookshelf wallpaper and minimalistic school desk in the window display. :D<br><br>I loved trying the trendy and the classic flavors. Cookies &amp; Cream and Coffee are my usual go-tos for ice cream flavors, and it&#39;s very good here - creamy and fresh. However, what I love is that they also carry flavors like vegan earl grey and thai iced tea. I must admit I doubted the thai iced tea at first, thought it would just taste like caramel, but it tasted like good thai iced tea in ice cream form. I also like their milk cereal flavor, light and reminiscent of the Momofuku milk bar ice cream in DC/NY but not quite as tart (or as pricy).

    	Delicious ice cream place! It&#39;s so cute inside also! If you come here, you must take a picture of the mural on the outside brick wall. When you walk in, it&#39;s pretty big. I loved all the book pictures on the wall. <br><br>Ice cream: Get the homemade waffle cone! They make them fresh! A guy was actually making them when we walked in. It&#39;s the same price as the cup, so it&#39;s worth it. I ordered the flavor cereal milk. It tasted like a more vanilla-ish Cinnamon Toast Crunch but without the cinnamon part. It was super creamy and so smooth! I also ordered the toasted fluff! You must get it! It&#39;s fluff they put on top of your ice cream and then torch it. My whole waffle cone, one scoop and fluff was about $5 and some change. This was my first time here but I would definitely come back if I&#39;m in the area again!

    	Richmond doesn&#39;t have a ton of ice cream places...so when I hear about a new one popping up, being the ice cream addict I am, I have to try it. Combined this love of ice cream with a love of quirky locations, and you&#39;ve made it a place I need to be. <br><br>This place is huge. The outside has a really cool mural on it, which my roommate and I had to take photos in front of, perfect for Instagram. Inside they had huge prints on the wall of books and a desk in the front window. It&#39;s a great place for groups  because they have long wide tables that must seat up to ten, plenty of space.<br><br>I ordered the mint chip, and the cashier thought I asked for vegan so he checked with me. This made me really happy because it means being vegan is important here, there are lots of options which you don&#39;t always see. I&#39;m not vegan but it&#39;s nice to have the choice. I asked for fluff on top because 1. I love fluff 2. I had seen it on Instagram and it looked cool. He added fluff on top of my handmade cone with its mint chip contents and roasted it, perfect. The cone was delicious, as expected. They also had a wide variety of cookies and toppings. <br><br>Overall, I really like this place and wouldn&#39;t mind trying more  of the desserts they have to offer.

    	I went to Charm School for dessert. I was kindly greeted after entering the dessert shop. Customers can sample different flavored ice cream. Trust me; it&#39;s hard to decide on a flavor with so many tasty options. I ordered a homemade waffle cone with cereal milk ice cream topped with toasted fluff and salted caramel sauce. Cereal milk ice cream is like Captain Crunch milk. Charm School ice cream, fluff, and caramel sauce were delicious! Their homemade waffle cones are delicious as well. The waffle cones are soft and flavorful. Charm School has a really nice ambience. Service was polite and attentive. There&#39;s street parking in front. Charm School is a great choice for ice cream or dessert date night. I give Charm School a 4.5 rating.

    	Hands down the cutest theme in RVA. They have a wide variety of delicious flavors and toppings...it literally took me about ten minutes to decide. I ended up getting their Toast &amp; Jam ice cream with a toasted fluff (marshmallow) over their homemade waffle cone. It was deliciousssssss! Will definitely come back!

    	Went with the cousins and had a little trouble finding parking space but it was well worth it. They have a varieties of interesting choices to choose from. The staff was very friendly when i asked to try a couple of flavors. I got two scoops of cereal milk and avocado ice cream and that was the best choice i&#39;ve ever made that day. There are chunks of cereals and avocados in each flavor that bring out  a  sweet, creamy, and addicting taste.  I also love the atmosphere and the decorations are pretty chic. Will definitely come again!

    	Charm School is a CHARMING little ice cream shop. The workers are hip and the ice cream flavors cater to quite the variety of palates. My boyfriend enjoyed the music at the shop, he says it enhanced the ice cream eating experience.  My favorite part is their in house made cones, which btw is no extra charge! Highly recommend, especially the coffee flavor! My one qualm about the place is their hours of operation. Open for more days and for longer times please!! I crave ice cream 24/7!!

    	The Mocha is awesome! The service is great, and their sandwiches are delicious (I had the grilled cheese with provolone)! It has a laid back and trendy vibe, which is great. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back.

    	This is the closest coffee shop to work, and a favorite afternoon break for myself and coworkers. I generally get a hot or iced tea and a croissant as an afternoon snack. The location is cute, I love the added touch of the metal bike sculpture out front. There is a decent amount of seating both inside and on the patio. <br><br>I do wish that there was a diverse selection of iced teas, but that&#39;s just because I&#39;m a tea drinker in a coffee world. The atmosphere can be a bit intimidating if you aren&#39;t used to the &#34;hipster&#34; coffee shop vibe, but everyone is super friendly! <br><br>This is a great local place to check out when you&#39;re downtown looking for a caffeine fix!

    	Came here on a rainy day to eat lunch with my sister and to be honest, I was disappointed in my hot chocolate order. It tasted watered down than a chocolate taste. I also ordered a sandwich to go with my meal. I forgot the name of it (my bad) but it looks and tasted exactly like a BLT type of sandwich that came with devil eggs on the side. The prices for their sandwiches were a decent price around $7-$8, but i felt like i could have made this at home because it did not taste anything special? besides their hot sriracha or mustard sauce.<br><br>seats are also very limited and because it was raining outside, everyone was inside and there were only around 6 tables inside. Its a cool hipsterish coffee type of coffee house too

    	Hands down my favorite coffee roasters and shop for the past several years, and I try to never miss it on a trip to Richmond, and I often bring home their outstanding freshly roasted beans. Try the brown sugar baby for a great espresso drink. Their sandwiches are great, too. This Addison St location is my favorite for the ambience - very hipster and eclectic, but not &#34;oppressively so&#34; to make non-hipsters (aka, me) feel out of place, with several great seating areas, both inside and out. It&#39;s often very crowded with a moderate wait, but never so much (on my visits) to steer me away. Their Summit St location in Scott&#39;s Addition is great, too, but I prefer this physical location.

    	Basic run of the mill breakfast sandwiches.  There&#39;s maybe four tables inside and some people bring their laptops so you may have trouble actually finding a seat.  I think there are better places if breakfast is what you&#39;re looking for.  I&#39;m not a coffee drinker so I can&#39;t comment on that.

    	The location on Addison is a relaxing setting for those who want to study in a quiet location or meet up with friends and chat. During my first visit to this business, I ordered a cappuccino that was made to perfection. I enjoyed how they did a little foam art with my drink too. <br><br>I went on a Sunday, which was busy, but the customer service was great and the wait time wasn&#39;t too bad. I like how they have outdoor seating so you can bring your pup along. And hey also have a water dispenser so you can stay hydrated for free. <br><br>The next time I visit, I plan on trying some of their food. It all smelled wonderful!

    	Tucked away in a really pretty residential area in the fan. Amazing coffee and their food is so great. I got the artichoke sandwich and my only mistake was not ordering two. So many vegan options and all of the ingredients are incredible quality.<br><br>Really easy if your busy and just need to pick up something quick. Customer service was great. I will definitely be back!

    	This is my favorite Lamplighter location, and although I don&#39;t live in Richmond anymore, I make a point to stop by Addison street to hit up Lamplighter everytime I&#39;m in town to get the thai iced coffee.<br><br>It is fast, since they pour already-chilled coffee straight into ice. And it&#39;s always delicious! I&#39;ll be honest and say I haven&#39;t had any other coffee drinks here because the thai iced coffee is so great. I have had the baked goods, however, and they are worth getting if you have a sweet tooth. I usually don&#39;t, so the coffee will always do for me!

    	Holy moly! For as highly-vaunted Lamplighter was my experience here left me puzzled - especially the ones raving about the coffee. The moment I took my first sip I was disturbed by how bracingly bitter and acrid the coffee was. In order to pull espresso that tastes like that, they are more than likely either pulling shots with grinds too fine or pushing water through that&#39;s too hot, I guarantee it.  Not my cup of tea so I&#39;ll stick to the food, which is good but I wouldn&#39;t come out of my way for anything on the menu. <br><br>The place also looks like a shack and hardly has spots to talk, much less work. I&#39;m pretty sure you aren&#39;t getting anything done if you try to work here because it&#39;s a tight, cramped feel with lots of laughter and people milling around. The folks here are super hipster/artsy and it&#39;s very conducive to people watching. It feels more like a hipster bar/cafe with not enough seating, so lingering is also out of the option because people are watching tables like a hawk or asking if they can have it the moment you stand up. Personally that&#39;s a little stressful so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll be back.

    	Very friendly staff and delicious breakfast sandwiches! One of my favorite egg sandwiches is the maple sriracha glazed sausage! Most of their egg sandwiches are $5.75 and served on a toasted bun. I think next time I order it I&#39;ll ask if they can put it on a bagel. Their coffee isn&#39;t my favorite when it comes to what Richmond has to offer, but they have a few different varieties and keep out a water jug sitting out with cups which I always appreciate. A selling point for me is the parking spots out front - definitely nice to not have to find street parking, especially if you&#39;re running in to pick up something quick!

A perfect stop for locals and tourists a like. <br><br>The lunch menu looks great and I plan on coming back for lunch one afternoon. <br><br>The display case with cold order sides and snacks isn&#39;t much to look at and could be improved.

    	BLUF:  Great coffee.  Great breakfast sandwiches.  Good vibe with nice seating inside and out.<br><br>I got a coffee and it was a great cup.  I take it black.  My fam got capps or lattes which are too fancy for my taste but they liked them.  I ended up buying a bag of whole beans which comes with a free cup of coffee.  Good deal.<br><br>I got the standard breakfast sandwich; egg, sausage, cheese but it also came with avocado.  It was good but not great.   <br><br>My bro-in-law got the ranchero sandwich and it was super awesome.  I def recommend that one over the first listed (standard).  <br><br>The staff was nice and the food was quick.  Popular place so I could see a long line and long wait but they were fast when we were there.  I love sitting outside so this place gets some extra points.  <br><br>Id def go back in the area for coffee or a quick sandwich.

	4.5...<br><br>Muna Module... Just do it.  Bacon, avocado, eggs on a light and fluffy with just a touch of crunch focaccia bread. Doesn&#39;t sound like much, but I&#39;m salivating as I&#39;m thinking about it right now. So good. Get the deviled eggs as a side with a cup of Americano and you&#39;ve got yourself a meal to brag about. <br><br>Okay, let me add to make just a little bit more useful.. A little outside Carytown, I had no issue with parking. But finding a table was proven to be difficult. It&#39;s not a place you go to for a cozy family brunch outing. Their outside tables are very communal which was fine with me, and bring a hat if you&#39;re there during the summer. Not a lot of shade. <br><br>But again, just get the Muna Module. You&#39;re welcome.

    	extremely affordable! My brunch date had the  BIANCHI 9.00 black forest ham, capicola ham, salami, provolone, red onion, pepperoncini, tomato, mixed greens, and italian dressing on focaccia which was very filling and delicious with a side of fruit salad. My sandwich had Canadian bacon a fried egg with Swiss spa delicious and very hot upon delivery to the table which was outdoors. (I forget the name) Unfortunately the fly swatting was a little intense but other than that no complaints. The ginger snap iced tea and Liberian ginger ale was tasty if you like your beverage to have a little spice.

    	I never ever write reviews, but I absolutely love this place. Yesterday, I visited the Juicebox for the first time. I took an afternoon yoga class and got a delicious smoothie (the eye opener) afterward. <br><br>The location is bright and inviting and will make you want to stay and chat with friends (and new friends) all day long. And this is exactly what happened during my first visit... I got so comfy that I finished my smoothie and decided to order a &#34;bulletproof coffee&#34; to finish up my Sunday Funday chat session with my girls. <br><br>Saadia and the other staff were so lovely; high energy, thoughtful, and very knowledgeable. They also sampled some of the delicious &#34;minty swiss&#34; smoothie which was a pleasant surprise. <br><br>I&#39;m actually planning to visit again, once I finish writing this review!

The ingredients are fresh and they offer a wide variety of beverages tailoring them to your liking with all healthy options.  <br><br>Perfect place to meet friends, read, do homework, etc. the staff was friendly and also willing to answer questions to satisfy your needs. The customer service was on point as well! There is also a studio section in the back where they offer classes like belly dancing, etc. <br><br>Definitely recommend trying out the banana java which has protein, milo chocolate, lavender, and other yummy smoothie ingredients another good choice is the turmeric raspberry with almond milk! Stop in and check them out. You won&#39;t regret it :)

    	With new juice bars opening up all over downtown  it was great to find one in the Jackson Ward area.<br> I honestly was just expecting  some cool fresh press juice and smoothies  but to my suprise they also had an awasome coffee menu . I got  the bullet  proof  coffee which is just organic grass fed butter &amp; coconut oil blended together with coffee . Ive read about this  in  magazine article and such but never actually found Cafe that had it . To my suprise  it was actually  good and I even  felt very energized. The deco is very welcoming and so are the staff. I see this place becoming a local spot where you meet with friends, sip coffee and have long conversations. <br>Cant wait to come back and try more of the menu items.

    	Honestly this place isn&#39;t as amazing as everything makes it out to be. The only good drink that I&#39;ve had is the blueberry lavender but even that has a slightly strong lavender taste. The smoothie combos are very interesting and I&#39;m always left unsure how I feel about it, and their wellness shots are absolutely disgusting but maybe that&#39;s the point because they&#39;re wellness shots. The cup size is also a little on the small side but it&#39;s pretty pricey for how small the cup is. Only pro is that it&#39;s a cute little shop!

My favorite is the Blueberry-Lavender smoothie, but the Post Workout smoothie is also delicious. Super friendly staff, they&#39;re always smiling.

    	I&#39;ve been really into smoothies and juices lately so I had to try this place! I was not disappointed! The interior is so adorable and they juices/smoothies are super light and yummy. I got the banana java. I was hesitant to order it because previously when I get smoothies with banana and chocolate they feel very heavy to me. This wasn&#39;t! It was light and not too sweet. I got the 16oz and it was a little under $8. They also had small treats like mini macaroons but they were too small for my liking but hey, if you&#39;re trying to eat healthy then that might be a good substitution. The staff was friendly and exudes a very positive, happy vibe.

    	Just what the Jackson Ward needed, a healthy/energizing/soothing light meal and beverage option! I stopped by for a quick visit this morning for a cup of tea and was pleased to see a menu of various options for smoothies, coffee/lattes, salads and more. I love the decor and bright open floor plan. This place has a yoga studio towards the back, digital menu boards and intimate/yet chill seating in front by the juice bar. <br><br>Though, I can&#39;t really write an all inclusive review of any of the menu options, I will say they have a selection of organic, natural tea and a 16oz cup only ran me about $2. Quick, easy, and just what I needed to kickstart my day. So happy to have a spot close by outside of Starbucks and I am very excited to get my green smoothie on in the future! Rating 5-stars because for the business only being open for two-weeks today.. the staff was super friendly and energetic &amp; the service was quick. <br><br>Will update this when I try more menu options :)

I wanted everything on the menu so with some guidance from Saadia, I settled on the lavender latte and an acai bowl. Both are incredible! Not only is this place adorable, comfortable and welcoming, the staff is super friendly. I will probably go back tomorrow! The chia puddings are calling my name.

The owner Saadia is an absolute pleasure along with all of her staff! When someone has PURE LOVE, heart, and soul committed into a business it truly shows. I have personally ordered 10+ items off the menu and every item has been nothing less then absolute perfection!

The Avocado and Chickpeas salad with Salmon is a good choice for lunch. Also forget about the flu shots. Get an immunity shot here ;)
